    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Orbx has recently made aÂ forum postÂ teasing some of the features of the upcoming Volanta 1.4 update, which includes a mobile app, a new - and updated - flight schedule source, and a stream overlay. There is no information regarding a release date yet, but it is said to be coming soon. TheÂ mobile appÂ will allow premium users to track their flights remotely with statistics, route map, and the possibility to remotely pause the flight (P3D, X-Plane and FSX only). It acts as an extension of the Desktop application, and easening tasks such as taxiing, thanks to taxiway labels and gate information, specially for users with just one monitor.Â  Itâs going to be available on the App Store and Google Play once 1.4 is out.Â   TheÂ new flight schedule sourceÂ is FlightAware, increasing the quality and quantity of the data available, with reliability on the flight number, aircraft type, etc.Â  TheÂ stream overlayÂ will provide a dynamically updated and customizable overlay for streamers, with information such as callsign, departure, arrival, ETA, ground speed and vertical speed.Â   TheÂ Discord Rich PresenceÂ is also getting a revamp, with more information shown, such as simulator in use, aircraft type, and a button that takes you straight to the flight on Volantaâs website. â  The built-in roster system, introduced on Volanta 1.2, has been improved, allowing users to schedule flights outside the real-world scheduling system, making it possible to plan out your entire daily schedule or maybe that long sought after world tour. They conclude the announcement with the information that there is more to come, currently being worked on.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

Opened in 2014, it replaces Doha International Airport as Qatarâs main airport, built on 22 square kilometers of land and able to handle 320,000 aircraft movements and 2 million tonnes of cargo per year. DOH is the first Middle Eastern airport to get the Skytrax's World Best Airport award (2021 and 2022), ending a nearly decade-long streak of Singaporeâs Changi. â Itâs the hub for Qatar Airways, with a route network that covers most of the globe, from their next-door neighbors of Abu Dhabi to San Francisco.

The scenery features a high-detail recreation of the airport, with an updated ground layout, high-quality ground markings and buildings, PBR textures, custom clutter objects, a basic terminal interior with the World Cup theming, 3D passengers, animated passenger train inside the terminal building, custom jetways, Qatar Airways hangar with an animated door, animated RGB road masts and flags, and support for the Aerosoft VDGS system.

Just Flight has recently published anotherÂ development updateÂ on their Fokker F28 Fellowship for Microsoft Flight Simulator, showcasing the lighting (internally and externally) in a 3 minute long video around an Air Anglia F28-4000. According to the developers, there are 50 dynamic lights covering the exterior, cabin, and cockpit.Â   The Fokker F28 Fellowship is a twin-engined regional jet developed in the late 60s, with its first flight in 1967 and introduced in 1969, with 241 units built after a 20 year run (production ended in 1987). Multiple variants were developed, with the F28-1000 seating up to 70 passengers, the F28-2000 housing 79 people, and the later revision, the F28-4000, featuring quieter engines (Rolls-Royce Spey 555-15H), a redesigned cockpit and modified wings, and increased seating (up to 85 passengers). It was then superseded by the Fokker 70 and 100.Â   As of 2019, there are no current operators of the F28 around, with Fly-SAX being the last to operate it commercially. Garuda Indonesia was the largest former operator, with 62 of them. Other Major operators include the Ansett Group (13), AirQuarius Aviation (4), and Biman Bangladesh Airlines (4). The Ansett Group was also responsible for the longest nonstop F28 route in the world, between Perth and Kununurra, roughly 2300 km apart.Â   Thereâs no information on release date or pricing yet.

It was the third most produced American fighter in WW2, with 13,738 units by the end of the production cycle in late 1944, playing an important role during the war, used by most allied powers.   From the hot and dry Deserts of the Middle East to the dampness of Europe, the Warhawk has been everywhere in WW2, with over 200 allied fighter pilots becoming aces flying the P-40. It remained in active use well after the War, by Brazil, Egypt, Finland, and Turkey. The Brazilian Air Force was the last to retire their fleet, in 1954. The iniBuilds P-40F features the latest in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) implementation from Microsoft, including the primary flight surfaces, control surfaces, and the propeller, with an authentically modeled Merlin engine which performs close to real-life figures (with feedback from type-rated pilots), a fully modeled fuel system, an electronic flight bag with maintenance page, moving map, radios, and weather information.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, scenery developer Dominic DesignTeam released their rendition of AustinâBergstrom International Airport (KAUS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The product will bring the Texas airport to life with high quality models, customized objects such as signs and passengers, and detailed textures. 	According to the developers, the scenery will feature PBR textures, dynamic lighting, and custom jetways. Additionally, for added realism, all pavements have been âpainstakingly hand-craftedâ and ground markings have been modeled based on the real life airport. 	AustinâBergstrom International Airport, located 5 miles from Austin downtown, is one of the main international airports serving the city. It provides flights to some 75 destinations around the world. Top operators at the airport include Southwest, Delta, and American Airlines. Currently, Dominic DesignTeamâs Austin Airport can be purchased on simMarket for $18.99 USD or EUR 20.10, excluding any sales taxes that may incur. The developers recommend at least 870M of free space in order to successfully install the product.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released an update to their rendition of Rovaniemi Airport (EFRO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the third busiest airport in Finland with 500,000 passengers per year. Itâs visited by many airlines during the winter season, which includes Aer Lingus, Air France, easyJet, Eurowings, Ryanair, Transavia, and Turkish Airlines.Â   Built in 1940, featuring two grass runways, and used as a Luftwaffe air base and supply center during the Second Soviet-Finnish War between 1941 and 1944. Rebuilding work started in 1948, with regular traffic returning in the beginning of the second half of that year.Â   The current terminal building finished in 1992, with its first expansion happening in 2000 (and the inclusion of jetways). The runway underwent renovation work in 2016, with new pavement and LED lights, and 2019 marked the completion of the terminalâs third enlargement.  The scenery update added conditional visibility to the winter objects, smoke effects for cold weather, glass improvements, and general fixes. The complete feature list for the scenery follows down below: Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for $6.69 (on sale, 50% off), requiring at least 1.23 GB of free disk space to install.
