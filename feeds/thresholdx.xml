    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Scenery developer Xometry is expanding into the MSFS2020 environment, as they've previewed their Victorville rendition in the new simulator. The upgraded scenery will be their first for the sim, and it surely won't be the last. Conveniently, VCV was their first airport in X-Plane 11, and it appears that Xometry is continuing that theme.Â  Victorville is a local legend among AvGeeks and aviation nerds in the Pacific Southwest. Famous for its vast graveyard containing hundreds of stored airline relics, the played a significant role in keeping aircraft during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fleets such as the Aero California DC-9s, Delta MD-80, MD90, and FedEx DC-10s have found their permanent home in the lower desert.Â  Unfortunately, the Xometry team hasn't provided an MSFS-specific feature list, so we'll give you their X-Plane 11 features: We'll keep you updated when Xometry posts additional information regarding the upcoming scenery. Join their Discord server to interact with the community if you're a prospective Victorville owner.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aircraft developer Rotate has announced the release date of their upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-11 for X-Plane 11Â via X-Plane.org's YouTube channel.Â The hyped trijet will release on March 24th. This release marks the first-ever high-quality heavy trijet in X-Plane 11. Since the project was initially announced in May of 2017, nearly five years have passed while the community has eagerly awaited its release. As mentioned before, MD-11 is the first quality heavy trijet that the X-Plane 11 community has ever seen. Complimenting this fact is the lack of high-caliber heavy trijets in any sim, as the CaptainSim L1011 TriStar exists as the last notable 3-engined model. Preceding the CaptainSim L1011, the PMDG MD-11 and JustFlight DC-10 were developed originally for 32bit platforms such as FSX.Â  Rotate has distributed some preview copies to streamers for usage in anticipation of the release. Q8Pilot is currently active on the YouTube platform, showcasing the aircraft in its full glory.Â Check out his channel to learn more about the upcoming release. Last but not least is the pricing of the MD-11; unfortunately, neither Rotate nor X-Plane.org have provided a specific figure as to how much the plane will cost, though it was mentioned in the comments of theÂ release trailerÂ that pilots could expect the trijet to be in the 80-90USD range.Â  â a special thank you to "Hampus Murling" on Discord for providing these screenshots of the MD-11!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Following the announcement of the release date on Tuesday, Rotate has delivered upon their promise and has launched their MD-11 for X-Plane. The MD-11 has been Rotate's active development project since its announcement in May 2017, almost 5 years ago. The aircraft accurately depicts its real life counterpart, currently only simulating the General Electric (GE)Â engine option in the freighter variant. Rotate has been sharing teasers and system previews of the widebody tri-jet frequently since it first announced the aircraft aircraft, mainly focussing on individual system areas during these updates. Nearing the end of the development process, the aircraft subsequently entered beta testing in late October of 2021. Following this long test period, the developer shared the aircraft with media outlets and streamers over the past weeks ahead of today's release.  Rotate has shared an extensive feature list on the product page, although the full thing is too long to share on this article, highlights of this include over 200 custom failures, and accurate simulation of all critical aircraft systems. Rotate has also announced today, prompting lots of backlash that the aircraft will see the passenger variant as an extra purchase. Seeing as the aircraft also does not ship with the Pratt and Whitney engines, and has lots of small bugs degrading the experience, the community is seemingly disappointed. You can purchase the highly awaited Rotate MD-11 for X-Plane 11 now from the X-Plane.org Store for $83.95.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The team over at Xometry Design is back bringing Victorville Logistics Airport to Microsoft Flight Simulator. This release brings the developers both attention to detail, and quality work to the Southern California Logistics Airport. The Victorville Airport is known for a variety of subjects, most recently being used as a aircraft storage and an aircraft retirement area. At its inception, the USÂ Federal Government was trying to situate the area after the closure of George Air Force Base, once coming to a conclusion, the airport was convereted to a Logistics Airport in 1992. Since then, the airfield has been used for cargo and airline logistics and storage. In 2020, as a result with of the COVID-19 Pandemic, many airlines both housed in the USÂ and outside the US, use this airfield for aircraft storage due to lesser demand on routes. Xometry has provided a detailed feature log upon release of this package. Starting off, detailed buildings and ground textures have been modelled with PBRÂ textures. Xometry has provided both a pre COVID and current renditions fo the airport. Disassembled aircraft parts can be found across the airfield, with including over 150 custom placed aircraft over the airport grounds. If you are interested in the full feature list, you can check out the products webpage. If you are interested in this scenery package and picking it up for yourself, you can purchase it over on the iniBuilds Store and sells for $17.00 USD. If you are interested in any other products by Xometry, you can check out their extensive catalog on the iniBuilds Store as well.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, scenery developer TaiModels released Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport (YSSY) for X-Plane 11. The airport, created using 4k textures, custom SAM jetways, and custom ground mesh, will serve as the gateway for pilots looking to visit one of Australia's most well known metropolises.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aircraft developer DCDesigns has released their rendition of the Aerospatiale Concorde for MSFS2020. The product is accompanied by MSFS native materials, a realistic flight model, and a complete operations manual. While it's unlikely that you don't know much about the Concorde, here's a bit of a history lesson anyway. The Aerospatiale/BAC Concorde is a French-British afterburning turbojet supersonic airliner that operated at a cruising speed of Mach 2.02. Considered a technological marvel, it contains the title of the most successful supersonic aircraft, beating its only "viable" competitor, the Tupolev Tu-144. It initially garnered interest from many airlines, such as Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, but production delays and hesitance regarding the airframes viability as a profitable mechanism led to mass cancellations of orders, leaving only British Airways and Air France to operate the aircraft. The Concorde is still the only "successful" supersonic airliner to date, even though the airframe's last flight took place in 2003. Today, most Concordes are presented at notable museums such as the Intrepid and Boeing museums, existing as figures of an incredible legacy of the past.Â  Rewinding to the DCDesigns rendition of the Concorde, it's imperative to mention that the developer designed the aircraft intending to simplify the plane so that it is accessible to all users without requiring "intense" studying to fly. Therefore, it's important to keep expectations humble as it doesn't compete with the likes of the FSLabs Concorde, for example.Â  DCDesigns' Concorde Features: You can obtain the DCDesigns Concorde for MSFS2020 through the JustFlight store for $39.99. In addition, aspiring pilots can check out the release trailer beforehand to get a glimpse of the aircraft in action. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The team over at FSimStudios has released their visual rendition of Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This release has brought an all-new look to the small regional Canadian airport. Before Toronto Pearson International Airport was constructed, Billy Bishop Airport served as Toronto's main airport. Being built in 1939, the airport served as the main hub for all air traffic. A decade later, the Canadian Government proposed an expansion to the small airport to increase passenger traffic to the area. Later on, with the airport receiving a regional jet ban in 1983, passenger air travel slightly declined. Now in the 21st Century, the airport was approved to receive the Airbus A220 for a limited time. For this release, the team has included a feature list of what is included in the scenery package. Starting off, the package has the current 2022 layout airport and more than 20 accurate handmade models of downtown Toronto have been included. Many helipads for Toronto's hospitals have been included for our rotorcraft friends to fly to. Static Q400s are an option for users to include in their scenery as well. The full feature list is listed below: This scenery is able to be purchased over on the simMarket Store and sells for â¬13.99. </summary>
