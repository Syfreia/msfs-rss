    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SuperSonic has recently released their rendition of Brindisi Papola Casale Airport (LIBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 20th busiest airport in Italy with a yearly average of 3 million passengers. â Built as a military airbase in the 1920s, commercial traffic only started a decade and a half later with Ala Littoria, a government-owned airline based in Rome. It collapsed after World War 2, becoming the now-defunct Alitalia. â The airport retained its military status until 2008, despite maintaining its military facilities to this day, although referred to by a different name: Military Airport Orazio Pierozzi. The civil name (Papola Casale) was given after Antonio Papola, a deceased Italian aviator with tight bonds to the city. â The airport is served by many airlines during the summer season, with Ryanair, AlbaStar, easyJet, Eurowings, ITA Airways, Swiss, and WizzAir being the few to offer routes all year long. The seasonal visitorsâ list includes Aer Lingus, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Volotea, and Vueling.Â  â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom aerial imagery, a highly-detailed terminal building with its interior, custom landside, custom ground textures, PBR textures, custom night lighting, and performance-friendly optimization. â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.66, requiring at least 928.44 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Skyline Simulations recently released the X-Plane 12 version of their John Wayne Airport (KSNA), serving Orange County with a yearly average of 11.3 million passengers.  â It started as an airstrip in 1923 and was purchased by the County of Orange in 1939, which has owned it ever since.Â  â After a brief period of Military usage during World War 2, it was returned to the County with the condition it remained open for all kinds of aviation uses. â  A passenger terminal was built in 1967, with 2,000 square meters of total built area, accommodating up to 400,000 passengers annually. It was expanded in 1974, 1980, and 1982, adding 700 square meters. â Eight years after the last terminal expansion, the Thomas F. Riley Terminal replaced the aging terminal with a 31,390 square meter facility that could handle millions of passengers. â It was then further expanded in 2011, part of a $543 million project that added a new terminal C with six additional gates and a new parking lot. â Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JSX, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, United Express, and WestJet serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with UHD textures, detailed 3D modeling, PBR materials on every building, custom orthoimagery, thousands of custom static objects, custom night lighting, ground traffic, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.68, requiring at least 678.37 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MagMexico has recently released their rendition of Tijuana International Airport (MMTJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the San Diego-Tijuana transborder agglomeration with a yearly average of 12.3 million passengers. â It was inaugurated in 1951 as âAeropuerto Federal de Tijuana,â with a 2000-meter long runway and a single passenger terminal, that was eventually replaced in 1970 by a much bigger one, part of a $8.7 million project that also included a runway lengthening. â In the 1980s, Tijuana was the fastest-growing city in Mexico, which led to further expansions in that decade. â The airport was privatized in 1995, becoming part of the Pacific Airport Group, which consists of 12 airports, with its headquarters in Guadalajara.Â  â Under the new helm, it was expanded and renovated in 2002, with many changes to accommodate the Boeing 747. By then, Tijuana was one of the most important airports in Mexico. â A cross-border express bridge was inaugurated in late 2015, allowing passengers to access the airport directly from the United States, with a North American terminal. â AeromÃ©xico, American Eagle, Calafia Airlines, Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n, Viva Aerobus, and Volaris serve the airport. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, animated jetways, dynamic lighting, detailed hangars and buildings, custom ground textures, precise AFCAD, static aircraft and vehicles, animated radar facilities, native volumetric grass and vegetation, and more.Â  â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $21.26, requiring at least 1.24 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlightFX has recently released their rendition of DuPage Airport (KDPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a general aviation airport serving the city of West Chicago, Illinois, with a yearly average of 135,000 aircraft movements. â It was built on former sheep-grazing land in the late 1920s by two Chicago entrepreneurs, and the U.S. Army eventually requisitioned it during World War 2 for training purposes. They built hangars and paved two runways, activating it in 1943. The hangar and the runways still exist, although one of the runways is now a taxiway. â Howard Aircraft Corporation opened a factory across the road a year later, in 1944. They built more than 500 aircraft for the military, which was then pushed across the street for testing at the airport.Â  â The airport was sold back to the county for $1 after the war, followed by a post-war boom that led to a new control tower, a new runway, and expansion plans that only came to fruition almost four decades later. â Midwayâs example (being unable to grow because of urban development around it) made the administration hurry to purchase more surrounding land and make it bigger, taking it from 360 hectares to 1,100 hectares by 1992, warranting control over all the property surrounding the runway complex and providing a larger buffer zone.Â  â It has an FBO offering fuel, parking, de-icing, catering, lavatory services, and a little passenger terminal.Â  â 95% of the yearly traffic corresponds to general aviation, 4% to air taxi, and less than 1% to military traffic. There are 255 aircraft based at the airport. â They recently opened a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (C.B.P.) facility on the first floor of the DuPage Flight Center FBO. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, built in coordination with the DuPage Airport Authority, with on-site photography of all major facilities used for reference, custom ground textures, high-resolution photographic textures, custom night lighting, interior modeling of key structures, in-hangar parking spaces, static G.A. and corporate aircraft, reworked landscaping, and ambient lighting improvements. â Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $14.75, requiring at least 2.92 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aamir Thacker, Fenix Simulationsâ CEO, has made an announcement on their Discord regarding the upcoming IAE update for their A320 add-on, initially scheduled for release in September.  After progressing quickly with the CFM external engine model, they have decided to delay the release of the Block 2 update so that users can get both engines with the new model instead of just the IAEs as previously planned.  Their work on the IAE model made them more familiar with external engine development and significantly sped up the process with the CFMs. The new timeframe for the Block 2 update with both engine models is sometime in October.  They have also confirmed an entirely rebuilt cabin for Block 2, with more detail, increased performance, and a lower VRAM footprint. â The Fenix A320 is available on theirÂ websiteÂ for roughly $60.98, requiring at least 1.8 GB of free hard disk space.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. WF Scenery Studio has recently released their rendition of Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (ZGGG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Guangzhou and Foshan with a yearly average of 40.2 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in China. â The airport opened 19 years ago, replacing the former Baiyun Airport (from 1932), which was deemed too small for the predicted passenger figures and unable to be expanded because of urban development around its area. It was built 28 kilometers north of the city, making it immune to curfews and noise restrictions, thus allowing it to operate 24 hours a day.  â It features two terminals, with Terminal 1 having three concourses and Terminal 2 - opened recently - being one of the worldâs largest terminal facilities with 808,700 square meters.Â  â Itâs a hub for 9 Air, China Southern Airlines, FedEx Express, Hainan Airlines, and Shenzhen Airlines. As the busiest airport in China, the visitors list is quite substantial and mainly from Asia.Â  â Â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, animated jetways, dynamic lights, custom ground markings, and more. â Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $25.31, requiring at least 5.64 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has announced that their next project is Southampton Airport (EGHI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. After initially teasing their next project a few weeks ago with a few screenshots, many eagle-eyed simmers in the community deduced that it was Southampton in the United Kingdom. That was officially confirmed today with a post by iniBuilds on their forum.Â  Southampton Airport was originally built in World War 1 for the Royal Flying Corps, and in 1917, was handed over to the United States Navy Air Service for a short period of time. It also served in a critical role for ground and air training for the Royal Navy in World War 2. It was also the site of the first flight of the Supermarine Spitfire. In the modern era, the airport is a hub for regional and international travel, and is home to many airlines including British Airways, easyJet, Aer Lingus, and Loganair. It also serves many operations to and from the Channel Islands. In their announcement, iniBuilds said that: âWe have gone into extreme detail into this scenery and you can see that we have covered a lot of detail in all areas of the airport.â They also provided an explanation on why they picked Southampton, mainly because many on their scenery team, including their Head of Scenery Development are based in Southampton. Also in their announcement, iniBuilds provided a list of features that can be expected with the upcoming scenery, which include: â They also included a trailer for the airport:  â The scenery will be released on Friday, September 29th with a price of Â£12.99 excl. VAT, or $15.86 USD. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. In a developer livestream hosted on Twitch on Wednesday, Jorg Neumann, the head of Microsoft Flight Simulator has revealed that UK based developer iniBuilds will be developing an Airbus A320neo for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 to be included with the release of Sim Update 14.Â  â According to Neumann, the aircraft will be âcompletely newâ and is âgoing to sit side-by-side, next to the Asobo A320neo that shipped with launch.â He also elaborated on quality goals, saying, âQuality goal is similar or better than the A310 that you already have and love.â Along with that, he explained why iniBuilds and Asobo wanted to create this aircraft from the ground up: âThe reason why we did that is because itâs going to be more complex, and we didnât want to break all the activities that weâre doing with the A320 already, that would have been a ton of work.â Neumann also confirmed that it will be released along with Sim Update 14, expected to come in late Q4 of 2023, around the holiday season. â This news comes into a market with many different offerings within the Airbus A320 family of aircraft for MSFS. Developers such as Fenix, LatinVFR, FlyByWire, and Aerosoft all either have A320 family products already on the market, or in development as is the case with FlyByWire and Aerosoft. What this news means for these projects is unknown.Â  â As of the time of writing, iniBuilds, who have previously worked in collaboration with Microsoft and Asobo in bundling their Airbus A310 with the simulator, have not publicly announced what kind of feature set their A320neo would have, let alone its existence.Â  â As further news comes in about this exciting new development for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Threshold will keep you updated, so stay tuned!Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Southampton Airport (EGHI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Hampshire with a yearly average of 631,458 passengers.  The airportâs history dates back to 1910, when its meadows were used as a take-off and landing spot for monoplanes, then known as Eastleigh Airfield. It was then transformed into an aircraft acceptance base for the Royal Flying Corps during World War 1.Â  â During the interwar period, the site served as a transit camp for refugees who wished to sail to America. Hangars were converted into dormitories for them.Â   Southampton Corporation purchased the site in 1932, naming it Southampton Municipal Airport, with part of it being utilized by the RAF after 1935.Â   Supermarine, a former British aircraft manufacturer, opened a test flight facility there and built a shed. Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft followed suit, later being bought out by Ford and utilized to manufacture Ford Transit vans until its closure in 2013.  During World War 2, the airport was transferred to naval command and renamed HMS Raven, spending most of it as a ground and air training facility. It was handed back to civilian ownership soon after, in 1946.  Thirteen years later, it was purchased by a racing pilot and began its transformation into a proper regional airport, with a concrete runway in 1963 and a railway station right beside it.Â   Itâs served by Aer Lingus, Aurigny, Blue Islands, British Airways (seasonally), Eastern Airways, easyJet, KLM, and Loganair.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-crafted ground textures, a true-to-life landside recreation, highly detailed models of all airport buildings, an up-to-date layout, fully modeled local points of interest, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $15.85, requiring at least 2.47 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSSDesigner has recently released their rendition of La Chinita International Airport (SVMC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Venezuelan city of Maracaibo with a yearly average of 2.8 million passengers (as of 2008).  It opened in 1969, creating a gateway to western Venezuela and consequently alleviating the traffic on Simon Bolivar International Airport, serving the capital city of Caracas.Â  â Nowadays, itâs the third busiest airport in the country, only behind Caracas and Porlamar. â Itâs served by Avior Airlines, Conviasa, Copa Airlines, LASER Airlines, RUTACA Airlines, Turpial Airlines, and Venezolana. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom taxiway signage, custom approach lighting systems, GSX compatibility, custom static objects, custom ground textures, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $18.44, requiring at least 867.65 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Tawau Airport (WBKW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Tawau Division in Malaysia with a yearly average of 572,000 passengers. â The airport was opened in 2001, replacing the former Tawau Airport, whose runway was one of the shortest in the country, and the administration decided to build a new airport from scratch instead of dealing with extra expansion work (that they had previously conducted in the 60s and 80s).Â  â â With a 2,685-meter-long runway, a much bigger terminal building, an instrument landing system, and night certification, the new Tawau Airport became an essential asset to the regionâs economy.Â  â It is currently suffering from limited capacity issues, with expansion plans to increase the numbers to at least 2.5 million passengers annually.Â  AirAsia, Firefly, Malaysia Airlines, MASwings, and MYAirline serve it. â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, custom groundpoly, custom jetways, and AI traffic compatibility. Â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.71, requiring at least 1.01 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Brazil Land Games Teases BrasÃ­lia International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/blgbsb" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/65187ccd758cc3b372e8acd3_bsb1.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="691720"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has recently shared screenshots of their progress on Brasilia - President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR), the third busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. â A proper terminal building was inaugurated in 1971, designed by TÃ©rcio Fontana Pacheco, a Brazilian Air Force architect. â The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more, divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. â New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. â Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. â The upcoming scenery is said to feature animated moving walkways, an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, detailed landside, and more. Thereâs no release date or pricing information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed. â</summary>
