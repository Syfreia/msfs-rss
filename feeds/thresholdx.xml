    <title>UK2000 Teases Glasgow Prestwick Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 has recently teased their work on a rendition of Glasgow Prestwick Airport (EGPK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fifth busiest airport in Scotland with a yearly average of 445,211 passengers.  â It was officially opened in 1935, despite operating as an airfield for longer (since the early 1910s). Passenger facilities were added in 1938 and remained untouched until the government made them compatible with jet aircraft. â The RAF used Prestwick to control trans-Atlantic flights during World War 2 as a gateway for US Army personnel and a training base for RAF pilots. â Its commercial duties started right after the war, with a transatlantic flight between Prestwick and New York. â The main runway was expanded in 1960 from the original 2,100 meters to 3,000 meters, which is still its current length.  â During the early 1990s, Prestwick was in shambles, desperately needing ârescue,â which came in the form of a takeover from a Canadian entrepreneur (Matthew Hudson), who constructed a railway station beside it, making it the first Scottish airport with its own railway station. To this day, Matthewâs rescue effort is unanimously recognized as heroic. â Ryanair embraced Prestwick in 1994, with a route from Dublin and a second route a year later to London Stansted. A third one followed suit in 1998, taking passengers to Paris-Beauvais. â 1998 also marks the ownership transfer from Matthew Hudson to the Stagecoach Group, a transport group based in Perth, primarily focused on buses, trams, and train services. They sold it three years later for 33 million pounds. â Infratil, a Kiwi company, was the new owner from 2001 onwards, responsible for revamping the main terminal in 2005 and redecorating most of it with very controversial touches. â After over a decade of ownership, Infratil decided to call it a day and pass it on to a new owner, which was no less than the Scottish government. They paid an incredible sum of 1 pound for it.  â As of June 2019, the airport is up for sale.  Itâs currently served by Ryanair, with flights to Alicante, Faro, Lanzarote, MÃ¡laga, and Tenerife-South. â There is no information about features yet, but they have mentioned itâs releasing soon for roughly $18.41.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Nu Simulation has recently released their rendition of Aji Pangeran Tumenggung Pranoto Samarinda International Airport (WALS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Samarinda and East Kalimantan in Indonesia with a yearly average of 662,000 passengers.  Opened in 2018, Sungai Siring Airport replaces the former Samarinda Airport from 1973, deemed unsuitable for the cityâs future due to expansion impossibilities (lots of urban development around its surroundings, giving it no room to grow), and it was already causing issues by the early 2000s when one out of twenty-five flights experienced delays due to the lack of stands. â Planning started in 1992, with construction beginning in 2005 and going through multiple delays after, which was initially scheduled for mid-2009. It only opened twelve years later, at a total cost of 400 million dollars.  â It covers an area of 470 hectares, with a passenger terminal occupying 16,468 square meters of total space, featuring four jet bridges.Â   â Expansion plans include a new passenger terminal, an additional cargo terminal, and aircraft maintenance facilities.  â Batik Air, Citilink, Lion Air, Super Air Jet, Susi Air, and Wings Air serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, a terminal interior, custom runway textures, and more.  â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $6.35, requiring at least 143.31 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Indira Gandhi International Airport (VIDP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the National Capital Region in India with a yearly average of 65 million passengers, making it the 7th busiest airport in the world. â â It was built as Palam Airport in the early 1960s, engineered to comport an average of 1,300 passengers per hour, which worked well enough for around 20 years, when the airport reached 30 million passengers for the first time, leading the administration to build a larger terminal in the 80s (four times larger!), inaugurated in 1986. Upon its inauguration, the airport was renamed Indira Gandhi International Airport. â A third terminal was built in 2010, handling all of the international traffic, while T1 and two were shared between three budget domestic airlines. â Itâs a hub for Air India, Alliance Air, FedEx Express, IndiGo, Quikjet Airlines, and Vistara. The visitorsâ list includes Air Arabia, Air Astana, Air Canada, Air France, All Nippon Airways, Air Mauritius, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Drukair, Egyptair, Finnair, ITA Airways, Japan Airlines, KLM, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, and Vistara. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, custom animated jetways, custom ground textures, improved lighting, ground clutter, and more. â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.86, requiring at least 1.19 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Lisium has recently released their rendition of Ventspils International Airport (EVVA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Ventspils in Latvia. â It was founded in 1939 as a basic airfield, with its first major revamp in 1975, including constructing its first asphalt runway and an apron. It was served by many AN-24s, AN-2s, YAK-40s, and MI-2s, flying scheduled routes between Ventspils and either Riga or Leningrad (St. Petersburg).Â  â The state also heavily used it for border control, pipeline control, forest patrols, traffic control, etc.Â  â â In 1983, the government decided to cease operations and close the airport, which was only reopened in the late 90s after the demand for it reached an all-time high post-Soviet Unionâs collapse.Â   â Rehabilitation work started in 1999, was completed two years later, and allowed operations to resume after many years of inactivity. Commercial operation began in 2008 for a few months and dropped immediately because of low passenger figures (less than 8,000).Â  â â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with fully modeled interiors, government-provided satellite imagery, high-resolution 3D models, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.58, requiring at least 601.30 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Tucson International Airport (KTUS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in Arizona with a yearly average of 3.3 million passengers. â It was built in 1948, replacing the former airport (Tucson Municipal), the first municipality-owned airport in the United States (circa 1919). They used three hangars that were utilized by WW2 manufacturing companies as the base infrastructure, along with a wooden control tower from the same era.  â A proper control tower was built a decade later, and commercial operations started two years prior with American, TWA, and Frontier.Â  â  A new terminal was inaugurated in 1963, with an international inspection station. It had already been operating internationally two years before, with Aeronaves de Mexico flying to Hermosillo. It was remodeled twice in the 60s and 70s.Â  â Twenty years later, the administration expanded the main terminal from 150,000 square feet to 300,000, rebuilding the concourse into separate structures with jet bridges. Further renovation happened in 2005, adding 82,000 square feet to the terminal and renumbering the gate layout. â  Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR texturing, custom animated jetways, custom ground poly, improved lighting, hand-placed ground clutter, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently announced the development of Palm Springs International Airport (KPSP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Palm Springs area in California with a yearly average of 3 million passengers. It was built by the US Army as an emergency landing field in 1939, later improved to serve as a staging field during World War 2. It was then sold to private buyers in 1946 and purchased by the City of Palm Springs in 1961 to become Palm Springs Municipal Airport. Airline service started with Western Airlines in the mid to late 40s, followed by Bonanza Air Lines a decade later.  Palm Springs was transformed into a dual runway airport in the 1990s and expanded with a new concourse in 1999, increasing its passenger handling capacity.  The pandemic aftermath brought record growth, thanks to the arrival of Southwest Airlines with year-round flights to Oakland, Phoenix, Denver, and Vegas (the latter started a year later).  Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Avelo Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Flair Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, United Express, and WestJet currently serve it. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, highly detailed models, custom night lighting, an up-to-date ground layout, LOD optimization, and more. It will be released next Friday (Oct 20) for roughly $18.17. Media previews will begin two days prior.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Paulo Ricardo Scenery Designer has recently released their rendition of SÃ£o Paulo - Deputado Freitas Nobre Airport (SBSP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 18 million passengers. Although initially planned in 1919, it only opened in 1936, with a 300-meter-long dirt runway, serving as an alternate airport to Campo de Marte, SÃ£o Pauloâs first airport. Commercial service began that year with a flight to Rio de Janeiro, served by VASP.  â Twenty years later, Congonhas was the third busiest airport in the world for air cargo while also serving all international flights to and from SÃ£o Paulo, as the runways were long enough to accommodate the aircraft from that time period, which was no longer the case in the 60s and 70s, with the advent of passenger jet aircraft, which led airlines to look for an alternative (Viracopos Airport, in Campinas). â The late 50s marked the creation of the famous air shuttle between Congonhas and Rio de Janeiro (SBRJ), with regular departures every half-hour. It used to be an agreement between three airlines (VASP, Varig, and Cruzeiro do Sul), with Transbrasil joining the partnership in 1968. The deal was dissolved in 1999 after airlines decided to operate their shuttle flights independently. â It was SÃ£o Pauloâs main airport until 1985 when Guarulhos Airport was officially opened, and restrictions were imposed to limit CGHâs daily flights. Even with all the restrictions, Congonhas still manages to be the most popular domestic airport in the city because of its convenience (Congonhas is closer to the cityâs heart).  â The airport lost its international category in 2008 after multiple restrictions were imposed regarding aircraft size, landing weight, etc. The Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737-800 are the largest aircraft allowed to operate in Congonhas, while it had previously dealt with DC-8s, 767s, and A300s. Accidents such as the TAM Airlines Flight 3054 (17/07/2007) made it more restrictive. â AENA has recently won a 30-year concession to operate the airport, which had been previously owned and operated by Infraero, a government-owned company. â Itâs currently served by Azul Brazilian Airlines, Azul Conecta, GOL Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, true-to-life landside, multiple city landmarks, a detailed terminal interior, custom ground clutter, custom weathering, and more. Itâs available on the MSFS Marketplace for $16.99, requiring at least 5.8 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

The new Freeware A340 will bring the avid Airbus flight sim captain a delightful smile.Â  Initially, today, there was some trouble from a few community members who decided to keep pressuring the development team into announcing a release time. Much to the backlash of some in the community,Â  X-Works postponed the release of the aircraft in an attempt to put out the fire that was burning in their Discord. Iâll leave it to those in the community to decide whether this helped.Â  The aircraft is loosely based on the Default A330 Platform but V1 will include the following additions and changes: â After a controversial and far from smooth release day, however, the A340 is finally here, and Sim pilots can now enjoy the four-engined beast in all her glory.Â  The aircraft can be downloaded via a link in the X-works Discord server.Â  â â</summary>

    <title>Taimodels Releases Cairns Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Taimodels has recently released their rendition of Cairns Airport (YBCS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Cairns in Queensland, Australia, with a yearly average of 5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1936 on 162 hectares of land bought by the Cairns City Council, originally sporting three runways made of cinders, red earth, weathered rock, and sand. Then, in the early 1940s, the Australian Government purchased the airport to adapt it for RAF use, paving and lengthening the main runway to comport larger aircraft. â Twenty years later, the airport was upgraded to receive jet aircraft, with an expansion and a runway extension followed by extensive flattening. â With the ever-growing passenger traffic figures, there was pressure in the late 1970s to expand the passenger terminal, which went on to happen in 1982. Finished two years later, it was just the first stage of three. The whole ordeal ended in 1997 with the conclusion of a three-story Airport Administration Center. â In 2007, the domestic terminal was redeveloped, costing the administration around 200 million Australian Dollars.Â  â The last upgrade started in 2019 and was completed a year later, increasing the departure hall area and adding dining and retail facilities. Itâs part of their plan to prepare the airport for handling up to 6 million passengers annually from 2027. â In early 2023, they announced the first major upgrade to the international terminal, rolling out in stages to minimize passenger disruption. â Itâs a hub for QantasLink and Skytrans Airlines, and served by Air New Zealand, Air Niugini, Airnorth, Alliance Airlines, Asia Pacific Airlines, Bonza, Hinterland Aviation, Jetstar, PNG Air, Qantas, Rex Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Virgin Australia. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made PBR ground markings, custom terminals, realistic lighting, up-to-date taxiways, performance-friendly optimization, and custom jetways. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.01, requiring at least 736.46 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Sibu Airport (WBGS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Bintangor, Sarikei, Kapit, and Sibu in East Malaysia, with a yearly average of 569,000 passengers, making it the 11th busiest in the country. â It opened in 1994, replacing Sibuâs former airport, which was demolished to make way for the Laila Taib College (its runway can still be seen, albeit partially).Â  â It underwent a massive expansion project in 2010, upgrading the terminal building and car park at a total cost of RM130 Million. With the upgrade, the airport could handle 1.8 million passengers per year. â AirAsia, Batik Air Malaysia, Malaysia Airlines, and MASwings serve it. â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout (2023), custom jetways, AI traffic compatibility, and custom ground textures.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $11.63, requiring at least 28.81 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!Â  â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Teases Upcoming EFB for 737 Lineup </title>
    <updated>2023-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Mathijs Kok from PMDG has made a forum thread showing a quick sneak peek of their upcoming Electronic Flight Bag for their 737 lineup on Microsoft Flight Simulator, along with a date to look forward to.Â  â While the teaser itself does not say much (aside from the preview), Mathijs has shared that Robert Randazzo will publish a feature list, more images, and a release date sometime this weekend. â It will be a free micro-update for PMDG.com and Marketplace users, but the latter will take longer because of Microsoftâs intake process. They estimate around 2-3 weeks from the release on their official website, and itâs just guesswork based on the average time it takes, according to their empirical data.  The 737 lineup is available onÂ PMDG.comÂ or via Marketplace, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $69.99.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
