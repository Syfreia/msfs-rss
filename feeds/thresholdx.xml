Members of the FlightFX discord will have been kept in the loop with the development process in the form of photos through various stages but just today we spoke to Nick from FlightFX who gives us a more detailed look at what has been done so far, and what is still to go.Â  âThe product is currently about to go to Beta.Â  Right now we are cleaning and polishing a few things.Â  Once in Beta, we will give them a dedicated feedback form on what we are looking to have them concentrate on.Â  The Alpha team has been mostly concentrating on performance and handling as that group is aligned with some of our Owner/Operators.âÂ  Nick goes on to further expand;Â  âOur Beta team will focus on the quality of life, visual modelling etc.Â  We expect them to break the aircraft.Â  Through each Beta round, we will connect and fix any remaining issues that we expect to roll out.â Addressing FlightFX fan's eager enthusiasm and interest to know a release date, Nick has wisely said; âWe have a launch date and price point known internally. We will make an announcement on those things once we are about halfway through the Beta process. We know people are excited and are very appreciative of the support. Just want to make sure we can clearly see the roadmap in front of us. Our policy has been to not state firm dates until the unknowns are off the table.â â Our thanks to Nick and the team at FlightFX. The Vision Jet is going to be fantastic no doubt and we will keep you all updated, here at Threshold.Â  â</summary>

    <title>No Money Mondays: Hong Kong Kai Tak MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/nmmkai" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/632842b3cd6b9928a6e4d323_UZ6LrSF.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="2255990"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Although it's been 24 years since the last time an airplane landed on the infamous runway 13,Kai Tak is still widely adored by flight enthusiasts all around the globe. Like the closure of Meigs Field, it marked the end of an era. Itâs impossible to talk about challenging approaches without mentioning the tricky checkerboard arrival, where a pilot had to fly low, slow, and close to apartment buildings. Pilots were also required to perform a flawless turn towards the runway, managing vertical speed and aiming for the runway threshold; simultaneously. Historically, KaiÂ Tak's runway 13 was one of the most challenging approaches in aviation. One of the most enjoyable perks of flight simulation is the ability to bring once existing airports back virtually, providing the opportunity to experience the thrill of landing in Hong Kong as it was in the 1990s. What if I told you you could experience Kai Tak for no charge in Microsoft Flight Simulator? Scenery developer ali501 shared his rendition on flights.to so that we can all go back in time to simpler days when Avgas and Jet-A guzzling airplanes were not much of a concern. An era long left behind, now to be revived in all its glory. With a fully modeled terminal, era-accurate static vehicles, and advertisements, itâs quite a throwback. ali501's Kai Tak is the perfect blend of No Money Mondays and throwback Tuesdays! Itâs hard not to feel transported back to 1998 when you spot things like the Flight Simulator 98 advertisement or the Motorola flip phone that screams late 90s nostalgia. A trip down memory lane for older folks; and a glimpse into the past for younger people. Ready to take on the Kai Tak challenge? Download it here; at least 2.04 GB of free disk space is recommended to install the product. Installation is as simple as it could possibly be: drag the ali501-kaitak folder into your MSFS Community folder, and that's it! Stay tuned to Threshold for more freeware recommendations. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. â â Optimization efforts are well underway from IniScene and their Microsoft Flight Simulator payware scenery, San Antonio (KSAT). The developerâs update, posted on both the Discord server and the IniBuilds forum mentions that they have dissolved photogrammetry in the immediate area surrounding the airport and that in and of itself has provided âmore than substantial increase in optimization,â according to the developer. Since the release of the scenery, some users have experienced stuttering issues, but the developer is hopeful that this update (releasing sometime this week-according to IniScene) will remediate any stuttering issues for users. â â Along with optimizing the scenery, IniScene has also modeled much more of the surrounding architecture in the vicinity. â â If youâre interested in picking up the KSAT scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator you can buy it directly from the Ini store, here or you can buy it from Simmarket. â</summary>
