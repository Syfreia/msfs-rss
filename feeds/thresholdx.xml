    <title>PMDG Publishes Update on 737-700</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, aircraft developer PMDG has published a new update on its much anticipated 737-700 project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, discussing the status of the aircraftâs testing, developmental progress, and upcoming plans. According to the developers, the testing of the aircraft continues smoothly, with some 70 issues reported by the testers and more than 120 solved by the development team. However, despite the 737 currently performing at a near satisfactory level, the developers expressed their frustration that MSFS currently lacks âtools that [they] would normally use to improve code stability and look for areas that require optimizationâ, preventing them from gaining vital insights on key areas needing improvements. In addition to updates on testing, the team also shined light on their current task of improving the details of some areas âto evaluate the impact different techniques may have on the performance of the simulatorâ. The developers are trying to gradually increase the level of details without sacrificing any performance, a process aided by their âincreased confidence in Asobo's rendering engineâ.Â The developer's progress is demonstrated by the completely rebuilt fire handles and light knobs pictured above. Finally, the developers revealed that a âfull bore promotional processâ will soon start, presenting the public with additional details on the aircraft and answering their questions. Currently, PMDG has not revealed the release date of the aircraft, claiming that its carefully designed workflow and testing procedure currently prevent it from determining a precise date. However, the developers teased that the 737 is âvery close to that pointâ where a firm release date can be set and the embargo can be lifted for beta testers. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After originally releasing a plethora of sceneries for Prepar3D and various freeware sceneries for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Emerald Scenery Design have ventured into the world of payware for MSFS. Marking the developerâs first payware product for Asoboâs simulator, the developer has taken to the backcountry of Alaska, with the release of Chunilna Cabin Strip. Located 11km to the Northeast of Talkeetna Alaska, Chunilna Cabin Strip is an unregistered airfield with an incredibly short runway, with anything larger than a Piper Cub providing quite a struggle for pilots. Featuring environmentally dynamic features such as seasonal butterflies, morel mushrooms, rain puddles, VFX, and more, Emerald Scenery Design claims to have brought this scenery âto life in incredible detail.â Furthermore, the scenery uses its own custom library which includes custom vegetation, 3D trees, custom ground textures, and more. The full feature list is viewable below. Chunilna Cabin Strip is available for purchase from the developerâs store or store.flightsim.com for a price of $9.99 USD. Furthermore, the developer is hoping to release the airport on the MSFS marketplace and flightsim.to, but is currently awaiting approval. As well, they are considering a release on Xbox but nothing is certain. Lastly, make sure to check out the official trailer for the airport via the developerâs YouTube Channel. As well, for further information, one can join the developerâs discord.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. As their name suggests, UK2000 have previously exclusively developed sceneries located in the United Kingdom for various simulators. However, the developer is taking a different path with the announcement of John Wayne Airport (KSNA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This airport marks the first scenery by the developer located outside of the United Kingdom, as well as their first scenery located in America. Citing the reason for the switch as âpart business and part getting bored with UK airports,â the developer has stated that their venture into the American scene brings a âleap forward in improved HD PBR materials and Level of Detail for UK2000.â According to the developer, KSNA is also set to include a plethora of accurately placed custom-made models created in an efficient way to limit file size, and line markings with âblack-bordersâ typically seen in the United States have been included. As well, UK2000 has remodeled their general aviation library collection to include additional details with PBR materials. Furthermore, new models have been added, such as the C172, SR22, P-51, and B17 for the airport museum. Additionally, the airside terminal interior has been modelled, along with â21 unique animated Jetways with high PBR details.â Unfortunately, no further information was provided, and no release date or pricing information is known. However, it was stated that release is due soon so Threshold will make sure to keep you updated on any developments that arise with this airport. In the meantime, make sure to check out the official trailer for KSNA via UK2000 Sceneryâs YouTube Channel.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aircraft developer Rotate has announced the release date of their upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-11 for X-Plane 11Â via X-Plane.org's YouTube channel.Â The hyped trijet will release on March 24th. This release marks the first-ever high-quality heavy trijet in X-Plane 11. Since the project was initially announced in May of 2017, nearly five years have passed while the community has eagerly awaited its release. As mentioned before, MD-11 is the first quality heavy trijet that the X-Plane 11 community has ever seen. Complimenting this fact is the lack of high-caliber heavy trijets in any sim, as the CaptainSim L1011 TriStar exists as the last notable 3-engined model. Preceding the CaptainSim L1011, the PMDG MD-11 and JustFlight DC-10 were developed originally for 32bit platforms such as FSX.Â  Rotate has distributed some preview copies to streamers for usage in anticipation of the release. Q8Pilot is currently active on the YouTube platform, showcasing the aircraft in its full glory.Â Check out his channel to learn more about the upcoming release. Last but not least is the pricing of the MD-11; unfortunately, neither Rotate nor X-Plane.org have provided a specific figure as to how much the plane will cost, though it was mentioned in the comments of theÂ release trailerÂ that pilots could expect the trijet to be in the 80-90USD range.Â  â a special thank you to "Hampus Murling" on Discord for providing these screenshots of the MD-11!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Following the announcement of the release date on Tuesday, Rotate has delivered upon their promise and has launched their MD-11 for X-Plane. The MD-11 has been Rotate's active development project since its announcement in May 2017, almost 5 years ago. The aircraft accurately depicts its real life counterpart, currently only simulating the General Electric (GE)Â engine option in the freighter variant. Rotate has been sharing teasers and system previews of the widebody tri-jet frequently since it first announced the aircraft aircraft, mainly focussing on individual system areas during these updates. Nearing the end of the development process, the aircraft subsequently entered beta testing in late October of 2021. Following this long test period, the developer shared the aircraft with media outlets and streamers over the past weeks ahead of today's release.  Rotate has shared an extensive feature list on the product page, although the full thing is too long to share on this article, highlights of this include over 200 custom failures, and accurate simulation of all critical aircraft systems. Rotate has also announced today, prompting lots of backlash that the aircraft will see the passenger variant as an extra purchase. Seeing as the aircraft also does not ship with the Pratt and Whitney engines, and has lots of small bugs degrading the experience, the community is seemingly disappointed. You can purchase the highly awaited Rotate MD-11 for X-Plane 11 now from the X-Plane.org Store for $83.95.</summary>
