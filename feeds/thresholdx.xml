    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their updated rendition of Leeds Bradford Airport (EGNM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving North and West Yorkshire with a yearly average of 3.3 million passengers.  It was opened in 1931 as Leeds and Bradford Municipal Aerodrome (or Yeadon Aerodrome), mostly used for general aviation and training during its initial years, with scheduled flights starting in 1935.  Work on the main terminal started around the late 30s but only reached full completion after WW2.Â   Avro constructed a shadow factory during that WW2 period called the Leeds Bradford Airport Depot, with over 5,000 aircraft before its closure in December 1946.  In the early 1980s, the runway was extended, allowing it to be classified as a regional airport. After the extension, Wardair commenced international flights to Toronto in a 747 in 1984.  The airport underwent expansion work in the late 90s and early 2000s, allowing it to reach an 88% increase in passenger traffic by 2007 (2.9 million passengers visited the airport that year).  The highest airport in the United Kingdom (681ft!) is an operating base for Jet2.com and Ryanair and is served by Aer Lingus, Aurigny, easyJet, KLM, and WizzAir.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date 2023 airport layout, fully-reworked PBR ground poly, custom lighting, LOD optimization to ensure best performance, animated custom jetways, a high-detail ATC tower with animated air traffic controllers, detailed walkway interior, hand-placed animated horses, a detailed spotting area west of runway 14, updated signage, and more.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $17.85 (V1 owners are eligible for a discounted upgrade fee), requiring at least 6.01 GB of free hard disk space to install.

The latest update introduces an addition of 62 new liveries, comprising 38 for the 787-8, 16 for the ATR 42-500, and 8 for the ATR 42-600. This brings the total livery count to an extensive 1900! Additionally, the update addresses model issues, fixing broken animations like flaps and reversers. Other enhancements include the incorporation of "drooping elevator animations" for parked aircraft. An all-around overhaul of aircraft sounds has been implemented, ensuring a significant improvement across all models. Start-up and shutdown sounds have been completely revamped, with specific enhancements catering to V.R. and headphone users. In addition, the effects have been refined for optimal performance on all model LODs, featuring optimized heat blur effects contributing to an improvement in FPS performance. The lighting system has undergone a substantial rework, introducing new options that include faux flare and no flare lighting. The default is set to no flare, with adjusted flash rates on aircraft strobes, nav lights, and beacon lights to better align with real-world standards. Taxi and landing lights are now fixed to the front gear, extinguishing upon retraction. Some parked aircraft now feature logo lights, different colors for interior lighting, and smaller lights for aircraft positioned farther away from the user. Wingspan values have been adjusted to approximately 10 percent below real-life values to accommodate the additional 6m of space added to MSFS parking stands. The final version 1.3.1 includes minor fixes, with the VMR file receiving a complete update and the correction of the ICAO code for Porter Airlines DH8D to PTR.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlightFX has recently released teaser photos of the cockpit of their next aircraft, which they dub âProject ApXâ for Microsoft Flight Simulator. FlightFX, known for their general aviation aircraft, such as the highly popular Cirrus SF50 G2, and the Honda Jet, Project ApX is shaping up to be another exciting development in the MSFS General Aviation market. Project ApX was announced last month, and speculation has abounded around what FlightFXâs next project would be. Now that these teaser photos have been released, many flight simmers have predicted that Project ApX is the popular Cessna Citation X business jet. The photos also show a great amount of detail, with high quality textures and models, from the seats to the switches. All of this hints at a very promising aircraft for the sim. While FlightFX have not given any other details on Project ApX as of yet, or much on their next project, the Piaggio Avanti II, Threshold will keep you updated whenever they do, so stay tuned!</summary>
