    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research has recently published a newÂ short-term roadmapÂ for X-Plane 12, delineating the next steps for versions 12.05 and 12.06.Â   With every 12.0X release, they aim to stabilize the product, complete or tune planned features, and improve performance. Since the early access release in late 2022, they have been working on maximizing X-Plane 12âs potential and overall experience with many bug fixes, improved AMD card performance, NOAA weather processing, and more.  For version 12.05, which is currently in Release Candidate, they plan to improve the A330 flight experience with a fully custom MCDU, autopilot, and flight systems. Based on real pilot feedback, the simulatorâs flight model was also improved, better matching the real world.Â   In the near future, 12.06 will deliver the result of three months worth of rendering engine improvements, according to their claim, with new cirrus clouds, lower VRAM use, improved cloud rendering in general, and OpenXR integration for VR folks.  It will also bring several ATC/AI improvements, with AI aircraft behaving more realistically, better conveying the experience of flying close to other aircraft.Â   Even further ahead, they have already made plans for 12.07, which should focus on improving lighting, water mixed render targets, networking fixes, atmospheric scattering, turbine engine improvements, and more.  Thereâs no release date for the updates yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <title>FlyByWire Simulations Teases A380Xâs Wing Flex </title>
    <updated>2023-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fbw380" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/645a9a77a5d90f86407e360f_wing1.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="1193830"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlyByWire Simulations recently published a YouTube video showcasing the wing flex physics of their upcoming Airbus A380 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. With each wing weighing around 50 tons and up to 150 tons when loaded with fuel, itâs far from the average wing out there, meaning the developers had to develop an entirely new wing flex system from scratch, correctly simulating the bending of the wing along its entire length, with varying resonance. They also state how each fuel tank has its mass and position in the wing, affecting the physics and increasing the complexity of such simulation. The work is still in progress, and the developers aim to bring a result as close to the real thing as possible. The A380 is a double-deck, widebody commercial airliner produced by Airbus. Itâs the largest passenger airliner in the world, with a seating capacity of up to 853 passengers in a single-class configuration or 544 passengers with a typical three-class layout. It was designed to address the increasing demand for air travel while providing a fuel-efficient and eco-friendly option for long-haul journeys powered by four engines (either a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 or the General Electric GP7200), with a range of up to 8000 nm. Despite its impressive features, the A380 faced several challenges in the commercial market. Its high price tag, maintenance costs, and the increasing popularity of smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft led to lower demand for the A380. In February 2019, Airbus announced that it would stop producing the A380 after delivering its final orders in 2021. Thereâs no information regarding a potential release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. OneHundred Simulations has recently released their rendition of TucuruÃ­ Regional Airport (SBTU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of TucuruÃ­ in ParÃ¡, Brazil.  Recently renovated, the airport got the green light to operate commercial flights in 2021 after a decade of inactivity. It was closed in 2015 because its infrastructure was deemed improper for any commercial operations, creating a significant hassle for the locals who depended heavily on the airport.Â   A hydroelectric plant nearby (Usina HidroelÃ©trica de TucuruÃ­) also weighed a lot on the decision to reactivate the airport, given they would have no way to get aerial rescue without an operating landing strip. On top of that, when the cityâs hospital had to transfer patients to a bigger city, they had to drive for over 8 hours. It was judicially reopened in November 2021.  The airport is relatively modest, with a 2,000-meter runway and a single passenger terminal, albeit with all the required bits for commercial operation.  Itâs served by Azul Conecta, with daily C208 flights to Val de Cans International Airport (SBBE).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of TucuruÃ­ Regional, with custom 3D objects, high-detailed textures, realistic ground layout, PBR texturing, and custom ground textures.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $8.75, requiring at least 45.79 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SDProjectsCO has recently released their rendition of Antonio RoldÃ¡n Betancur Airport (SKLC), serving the town of ApartadÃ³ in Antioquia, Colombia, with a yearly average of 210,000 passengers.  The airport was named after Antonio RoldÃ¡n Betancur, a Colombian politician who served as Governor of Antioquia in the late 1980s. The airport was built in the late 1960s to early 1970s, primarily to serve the needs of the local population and to facilitate the transportation of goods and people in and out of the region.  The airport had a single dirt runway and elementary facilities in the early years. Over time, the runway was paved, and a small terminal building was constructed. However, the airport remained relatively small and basic, serving mainly as a regional airport with limited flights to other cities in Colombia.  In recent years, the airport has seen some improvements and expansions. In 2014, the runway was extended to accommodate larger aircraft and the terminal building was renovated and expanded to improve passenger comfort and service. The airport now has a modern terminal building with check-in counters, waiting areas, and other amenities.  EasyFly serves it with a route to MedellÃ­n - Olaya Herrera, and SATENA with two routes: BogotÃ¡ and MedellÃ­n - Olaya Herrera.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a high-detail 3D model of the main terminal, PBR texturing, custom night lighting, custom ground textures, a true-to-life airport layout, and custom ground clutter.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. VueloSimple has recently released their rendition of Teniente General BenjamÃ­n Matienzo International Airport (SANT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of San Miguel de TucumÃ¡n in Argentina, with a yearly average of 500,000 passengers.  Built in the early 1980s and inaugurated in 1986, replacing the older TucumÃ¡n airport, which sat right in the center of the city, with no room to expand in length (and it only had a 1,600-meter runway), and with noise abatement restrictions creeping in, they had no choice but to close it.  The new airport features four departure gates, two arrival gates, immigration services, and the second-largest cargo terminal in Argentina.Â   Itâs named after General BenjamÃ­n Matienzo, who died trying to fly over the Andes to Chile.  In September 2017, the single runway was extended from 2,900 meters to 3,500 meters, making it the second-longest runway in the country.Â   Itâs served by Aerolineas Argentinas (Buenos AiresâAeroparque, CÃ³rdoba (AR), Puerto IguazÃº, Salta, San Carlos de Bariloche, SÃ£o PauloâGuarulhos), Andes LÃ­neas AÃ©reas (Cayo Largo del Sur), FlyBondi (Buenos AiresâAeroparque), and JetSmart Argentina (Buenos AiresâAeroparque, Buenos AiresâEzeiza).

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SiamFlight has recently released their rendition of Chiang Mai International Airport (VTCC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in Thailand with a yearly average of 11 million passengers.  In the early days, the airport was a small airfield used primarily by the Royal Thai Air Force. In the 1950s, the Thai government recognized the need for a larger airport to serve the growing city of Chiang Mai and decided to expand the airfield. In 1954, the airport officially opened to commercial traffic, with Thai Airways operating the first scheduled flight to Bangkok.  Over the next few decades, Chiang Mai International Airport underwent several expansions and renovations to accommodate the increasing number of passengers and airlines. In 1995, a new international terminal was built, which increased the airport's capacity to handle more international flights.  The most recent expansion dates back to 2014, when Airports of Thailand (the operator) expanded the apron for larger aircraft, enlarged the terminal (international arrival hall and domestic departure hall) and made it a 24/7 airport.  It's a focus city for Bangkok Airways (BangkokâSuvarnabhumi, Koh Samui, Krabi, Phuket), Nok Air (BangkokâDon Mueang, Ubon Ratchathani, Udon Thani), Thai AirAsia (BangkokâDon Mueang, BangkokâSuvarnabhumi, BeijingâDaxing, Changsha, Da Nang, Hangzhou, Hanoi, Hat Yai, Hua Hin, Hong Kong, Khon Kaen, Krabi, Macau (resumes 1 July 2023), Phuket, Singapore, Surat Thani, TaipeiâTaoyuan), and Thai Smile (BangkokâSuvarnabhumi). The visitors' list includes Air China, China Airlines, EVA Air, Jeju Air, Korean Air, Spring Airlines, and VietJet Air.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom 3d models for the terminal, control tower, tango squadron museum, cargo terminal, new parking building, and more. The jetways are customized, with normal and glass variants, and it sports custom ground markings, VDGS, custom night lighting, and hand-placed ground objects. The developers also listed some upcoming features that will come free of charge with an update:   It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.29, requiring at least 173.15 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSimStudios has recently released their rendition of William P. Hobby Airport (KHOU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Greater Houston with a yearly average of 13 million passengers.  Opened in 1927 as a private landing field in a pasture, it quickly became a full-blown airport. It got its first bits of commercial traffic in the early 30s by the wings of Braniff International Airways and Eastern Air Lines. Seven years later, it was purchased by the city of Houston and named Houston Municipal Airport (it was initially called W. T. Carter Field). A year later, in 1938, it was renamed Howard R. Hughes, responsible for several airport improvements. The name was quickly changed because the regulations didnât allow federal improvement funds for an airport named after a living person.Â   With the advent of Houston Intercontinental Airport in 1969, most airlines went to the new airport, leaving HOU with no scheduled traffic. It wasnât until the 70s, with Houston Metro Airlines, a small commuter airline, that the airport saw the resumption of passenger services. It was a cross-town service from the airport to IAH.Â   Southwest embraced HOU in 1971, flying nonstop to Dallas Love Field and San Antonio, followed by Braniff and Texas International shortly after to offer some competition.  Currently, Southwest holds most of the market share, flying to over 50 destinations all over North and Central America. Itâs also served by Allegiant Air, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, and Frontier Airlines, albeit with a substantially smaller participation in raw passenger volume.  The busiest destinations from Houston Hobby are Dallas Love Field, Denver, and Atlanta, with 380,000, 327,000, and 325,000 passengers each, respectively.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a high-quality 3D model of the passenger terminal and its interior, custom ground textures, improved high-resolution orthographic imagery, an up-to-date AFCAD (as of 2023), custom taxiway signs, handmade PBR textured buildings, and the Hobby Airport DoubleTree Hilton.  Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $18.98, requiring at least 1.8 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to Tang0 for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PILOT'S GesmbH has recently published a couple of work-in-progress screenshots of their upcoming de Havilland Canada Dash 7 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This classic turboprop regional airliner preceded the popular Dash 8. First flown in 1975, the Dash 7 is a "Twin Otter but larger and with four engines," with oversized fan blades that would rotate at a slower speed to emit as little noise as possible, complying with the noise restrictions that were starting to creep in. It could carry up to 50 passengers, with a service ceiling of 21,000 feet, and 690 nautical miles of range, all powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-50 turboprop engines, with 1,120 hp each. As of July 2018, 17 Dash 7s were still flying around the world with six different operators. However, the list of former operators is substantial: sixty civilian operators and three military operators. PILOT'S rendition is "nearing release," according to the developers, followed by a collection of screenshots showcasing the interior and exterior of their upcoming product. They claim to be continuously fixing bugs and tweaking the aircraft's behavior to match reality, with one more beta cycle to go until it's ready to release (according to their prediction).

    <title>PMDG Publishes New Development Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Robert Randazzo, PMDGâs Founder, has published another development update for Microsoft Flight Simulator regarding an upcoming patch for the 737 lineup and its eventual release on Xbox, more info on the EFB, and more.  TheÂ forum postÂ begins with Randazzo explaining an issue with his internet connection, which has delayed both the update on PC and the 737âs arrival on Xbox, which are set to release soon. They plan to release a complete set of micro-updates for the 737 next week, including the aforementioned AFDS improvements, a few more fixes and tweaks, and the mitigation of a long existing bug with the V-speed computations misapplying corrections for head/tail wind components.  Randazzo also reminds everyone that the marketplace update will take longer due to Asoboâs approval process. His estimation for the rollout is either May 18 (the most favorable outcome) or May 25. The same applies to the Xbox version, which was pushed simultaneously.  Still on that Xbox note, Robert says that the 737 for Xbox wonât have any extra liveries to begin with, as their original plan was to wait for the liveries to be approved first, but they saw lots of feedback on their forum from the console simmers that would not mind an early release without any livery packs for the time being. Liveries of which, to no fault of their own, will cost $4.99 per pack (the in-game marketplace does not allow for free content, and that price tag is the minimum value).Â   The Universal Flight Tablet is still being worked on, with work going on refining the PERF process and refinement on native mapping features for non-Navigraph subscribers while also working hard on the Navigraph integration for Navigraph customers. They also made sure to explain once again why it has been taking so long to come out, bringing up how itâs a sandboxed environment and the communication between that environment and the âexternal worldâ is a little bit complicated.Â   They finish the UFT news bit with the information that an external-to-PMDG developer is working on adding extra functionalities, âshowing what the tablet is truly capable of.âÂ  Its initial release is said to bring a ânumber of features,â with more to come. âNavigraph and Simbrief users will be pleased by the care that has gone into ensuring a nice, tight weave between our technology and theirs,â said Randazzo.Â  â The DC-6 update has been pushed to the marketplace, and the expected date is the same as the 737âs update. Either May 18 or May 25. Non-marketplace owners will get a micro-update this week incorporating these changes, which, according to Randazzo, should be transparent.  The development update ends with more information on the 777, which is progressing nicely, and they claim to be very happy with how things are going.  The 737 Lineup and the DC-6 are available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ and in the MSFS Marketplace (partially).Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Impulse Simulations has recently released their rendition of Alice Springs Airport (YBAS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Alice Springs, Australia, with a yearly average of 600,000 passengers.  The airport, originally named Seven Mile Aerodrome, was built in the 1940s by the Australian Department of Defence and used by the Royal Australian Air Force and the USAF during World War 2. It was an important refueling and staging facility run by No. 57 Operational Base Unit. It only got its current name way after the war, in 1958.  As a curiosity, it has the first large-scale aircraft boneyard outside of the United States. Operating since 2014, the Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage offers a dry and safe environment for long-term storage of airplanes, be it a functioning plane but not in use or decommissioned units that will be scrapped for parts.  It is served by Airnorth (Darwin, Katherine, Tennant Creek), Alliance Airlines (charter), Qantas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney), QantasLink (Adelaide, Darwin), and Virgin Australia (Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with realistic ground &amp; apron texturing, custom night lighting, a partially replicated cafe interior, full PBR texturing, custom animations, custom vegetation &amp; grass, a detailed static graveyard, over a hundred custom-modeled objects and buildings, custom taxiway signage, 20,000 hand placed objects, and more than a hundred custom assets.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $19.90, requiring at least 3.34 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>EcuaVirtual3D Releases Seymour Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. EcuaVirtual3D has recently released their rendition of Seymour Galapagos Ecological Airport (SEGS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the island of Baltra, one of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands in Ecuador. Itâs the third busiest airport in the country, with a yearly average of 500,000 passengers.  The airport was originally built by the United States during World War II as a military base for surveillance of the Pacific Ocean. After the war, the airport was used mainly for commercial traffic (and as a stopover for flights between South America and North America). It was eventually handed over to the Ecuadorian government in the 1960s.  In the 2000s, it was renovated to meet the requirements of the increasing number of tourists visiting the Galapagos Islands, designed with an eco-friendly concept, keeping in mind the fragile ecosystem of the Islands. The new terminal, built with recycled steel tubes from oil drilling operations in the Amazon, uses clean, renewable technologies such as solar energy, wind farms, and seawater desalination. It became the worldâs first âgreenâ airport in 2012.  The airport was named after British naval officer and scientist Sir Seymour de Ricci, who visited the Galapagos Islands in the early 1900s and contributed significantly to the scientific knowledge of the region.Â   Due to its location in a sensitive ecosystem, the airport has implemented strict regulations to minimize the impact of air traffic on the environment. For example, the airport uses solar panels to generate electricity and a rainwater harvesting system to conserve water. The airport also has a waste management system to minimize the impact of garbage on the environment.  Itâs served by Avianca Ecuador, Equair, and LATAM Ecuador, with direct flights to Guayaquil and Quito.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a faithful replica of the terminal, custom taxiway signage, custom static objects, HDR lighting, custom textures with ambient occlusion, custom approach lighting systems, and a custom mesh around the airport.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.38, requiring at least 112.20 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>3DVirtualSim Releases Brest Bretagne Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/3dvbre" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6462001d777e1641f994a284_brest1.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="1566690"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. 3DVirtualSim has recently released their rendition of Brest Bretagne Airport (LFRB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Brest in western France with a yearly average of 1 million passengers.  The airportâs origin dates back to World War I when the US Army built two airship hangars, which were abandoned right after the war until the late 1930s when it also got an airstrip. The air base, though, didnât survive World War 2, with its infrastructure being destroyed by air raids, rendering it practically useless.Â   Rebuilding efforts only took place in the early 1950s, with the airport being reopened for commercial use in 1952, connecting Brest to Ouessant and Paris by the wings of Air Inter.Â   With the popularization of air travel and the consequent increase in passenger volume, the airport underwent a huge expansion project in 1986, followed by a runway extension six years later, transforming the airport into a diversion ground for transatlantic flights. By 1989, the airport was averaging 500,000 passengers a year for the first time.  In December 2007, they inaugurated a brand new terminal, with 22,000 square meters of total area, able to accommodate up to 1.8 million passengers a year, with two wide-body jetways and fourteen stands for medium and small aircraft. Itâs shaped like a manta ray.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, an intricately modeled interior, dynamic jetways, reworked aerial imagery to match Bingâs colorimetry, realistic ground textures, and custom night lighting.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.62, requiring at least 1.39 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
