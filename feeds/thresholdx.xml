    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Carenado has recently showcased various screenshots of their upcoming visual rendition of the Pilatus PC-12 aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This comes after a period of tight-lipped silence from the developers. Carenado did express an apologetic state, as they have experienced unexpected delays in the release of this aircraft to the public. They do hope to surpass these setbacks and move forward with the release aircraft. In the screenshots posted to their Facebook page, they showcased working GTNXi by TDS, and the in-house EX600 Suite. With these operational, Carenado hopes to move forward with development and an eventual release. Be sure to follow Threshold for more updates.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Last week, developer Thranda announced via the X-Plane forum the release of a new expansion pack for its C208 and C208B Grand Caravan. The best part: this pack is completely free and can be downloaded from the X-Plane.org store! The feedback on the forum is very positive. Users seem to be delighted with this free and well-developed initiative. But what exactly does this pack contain? First of all a seaplane version of the Grand Caravan equipped with floats. â For the landplane version, the pack offers tundra tires and mud flaps, enabling operations in rough terrains. The package also offers changes to the interior of the aircraft such as an integrated G1000. The seats will also be removable via presets, allowing the aircraft to serve either as a passenger or cargo plane. These features will be available for both the amphibious and landplane models. Currently, users who already purchased the plane can download the expansion pack together with the new version. Those who are looking to pick up the aircraft can purchase it on the X-Plane.org store for $44.95, â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, developer Just Flight published a brief update for its upcoming Fokker F28 Fellowship for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The short blog focused on the work being done on the aircraftâs interior modeling/texturing and cockpit lighting. Announced just over a year ago, Just Flightâs Fokker F28 has seen extensive work being done on it over the past few months. Since the last update, the developers have been making âextensive upgrades to the cockpitâ. Due to the great variations in cockpit design that exist between the F28 variants operated by different airlines, the team chose to base their design on the real F28 they visited in Fokker Technical College. With the layout finalized, the developers are working to improve the visual fidelity of the cockpit while testers, including Â âF28 flight, engineering, and training crewâ, are checking and rechecking every detail. Apart from cockpit modeling, progress has also been made in cockpit lighting. Just Flight has included a few pictures in the update to showcase the night lighting of the Fokkerâs instruments, annunciator, and warning lights. Currently, Just Flight is yet to announce the release date and pricing of the aircraft. Threshold will keep you updated on this front.

After complimenting the CEO of iBlueYonder, Bill Womack, IniBuilds revealed that it has already started development on KDAL. However, neither developers have disclosed any details on either the scenery or the partnership. Though IniBuilds is well known within the community, iBlueYonder may be a less familiar face to some.

Though Lovefield is often overshadowed by Fort Worth, it is located much closer to Dallas city center and serves as a main hub for Southwest Airlines, a well-known low cost airline that operates an all 737 fleet. Southwest, Delta and Alaska also flies a few flights to select destinations per day. â The IniBuilds forum post ends with the announcement of a trailer about this airport that will be available soon.

After the great success of the B-146 Professional for x-plane 11, the developers of Just Flight have set themselves a new challenge: As in real life, they want to develop the 146 Professional into the RJ Professional, a new range that will be exclusively available for MSFS.

Variants exclusively available for MSFS. â If we look at the historical context of aviation, the RJ range, derived from the 146 range from 1993 onwards (1988 for the RJ100). We can note improvements made from this date, such as the introduction of an EFIS cockpit with digital displays replacing the ADI, HSI and engine instrumentation present on the 146. â This is exactly what Just Flight is putting forward in the development of the RJ Professional, the same changes are being implemented. There have been many other changes between the 146 and the RJ, both in real life and in the simulation world with Just Flight indicating these changes on the aircraft web page. â â â On the 15th of August, Just Flight published development updates with images available of this future product, both cockpit and exterior model images are seen, without telling us much more.

The comanche is still ever popular to this day and you can find them flying in many countries. Never before in X-plane 11 has the Comanche 250 been developed in such detail and its sure to be an impressive aircraft when it is finished.  Progress is going well on the Comanche with release planned for Q4 2022. We can see from previews supplied by InDepthSimulations that the modelling and texture work is progressing nicely.  â The IDS comanche 250 will boast options for a modern avionics suite using the RSG G5 and G500, but if this isn't to your liking it will also have the option to use a standard 6 pack "steam gauge"Â setup.  â Although still on target, development of the Comanche 250 has slowed slightly due to a small team, the developer has encouraged anyone who may be interested in joining up to assist in pushing this beautiful aircraft across the line to contact them through Discord â Threshold will keep you updated on developments with the IDS comanche as it progresses closer to the finish line!Â </summary>
