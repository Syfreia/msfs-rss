    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, the developers of Microsoft Flight Simulator announced the release of its newest aircraft - Beechcraft Bonanza V35.  The Bonanza, developed by Carenado and published in partnership with Microsoft, is the third aircraft in MSFSâs new Famous Flyers series. The plane is powered by a 6-cylinder Continental IO-520B piston engine and has a 900 mile maximum range. It also features an iconic V-shaped tail that works as âa hybrid of a rudder and an elevatorâ. Unfortunately, neither Carenado or Microsoft released a feature list for the Bonanza. However, a trailer is available to those who are trying to catch a glimpse of what the aircraft has to offer. Currently, the V35 can be bought in the ingame Marketplace for $14.99 USD. Microsoft has teased that the next aircrafts of the Famous Flyers series will be coming soon. Threshold will keep you updated on this front.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After the great success of the B-146 Professional for x-plane 11, the developers of Just Flight have set themselves a new challenge: As in real life, they want to develop the 146 Professional into the RJ Professional, a new range that will be exclusively available for MSFS. Just Flight are excited to announce that they are working on the RJ professional range which will include 3 variants: The RJ70, the RJ85 and the RJ100. Variants exclusively available for MSFS. â If we look at the historical context of aviation, the RJ range, derived from the 146 range from 1993 onwards (1988 for the RJ100). We can note improvements made from this date, such as the introduction of an EFIS cockpit with digital displays replacing the ADI, HSI and engine instrumentation present on the 146. â This is exactly what Just Flight is putting forward in the development of the RJ Professional, the same changes are being implemented. There have been many other changes between the 146 and the RJ, both in real life and in the simulation world with Just Flight indicating these changes on the aircraft web page. â â â On the 15th of August, Just Flight published development updates with images available of this future product, both cockpit and exterior model images are seen, without telling us much more. They simply inform us that work is still in progress, that pictures are available and that they will keep us informed of future updates. But for the moment, there is no official release date for this aircraft. â â â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. InDepthSimulations have provided fans with an update in the development of their PA-24 Comanche 250 for X-plane 11. Exclusive news to threshold was provided by the lead developer from IDS around the future of the comanche project and whats to be expected!Â  The comanche 250 first flew in 1956 and production ceased in 1972 with just under 5,000 of the aircraft rolled off the production line. The comanche is still ever popular to this day and you can find them flying in many countries. Never before in X-plane 11 has the Comanche 250 been developed in such detail and its sure to be an impressive aircraft when it is finished.  Progress is going well on the Comanche with release planned for Q4 2022. We can see from previews supplied by InDepthSimulations that the modelling and texture work is progressing nicely.  â The IDS comanche 250 will boast options for a modern avionics suite using the RSG G5 and G500, but if this isn't to your liking it will also have the option to use a standard 6 pack "steam gauge"Â setup.  â Although still on target, development of the Comanche 250 has slowed slightly due to a small team, the developer has encouraged anyone who may be interested in joining up to assist in pushing this beautiful aircraft across the line to contact them through Discord â Threshold will keep you updated on developments with the IDS comanche as it progresses closer to the finish line!Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After having developed the A310 for MSFS, iniBuilds announces the continuation of its partnership with MSFS with two new aircraft under development: The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny and the Grumman G-21A Goose. Both aircraft will be 100% free and developed exclusively for MSFS. In a forum post, the CEO of iniBuilds is pleased to announce the continuation of their partnership with MSFS with these two historic aircraft under development. The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny, was a military training aircraft with production starting in 1915. After the end of the First World War, there was a surplus of aircraft that became civilian aircraft in 1918. From then on, the JN-4 became a very popular trainer for solo training flights, for the civilian market. It is therefore a historic aircraft full of adventure and history that iniBuilds is developing for a modern simulator, more than 100 years after the real-life Curtiss JN-4 Jenny was released. The second aircraft under development, the Grumman G-21A Goose, has a different story. Originally, it was a group of Long Islanders who wanted a business aircraft to fly to and from New York. So they approached Grumman. Following discussions, Grumman converted the Grumman Goose and that's how the G-21A was born, in around 1936. The G-21A was later upgraded to carry 8 passengers and fly military missions all over the world. iniBuilds has endeavoured to reproduce this atmosphere in the aircraft cabin with a bar, champagne bucket and restroom facilities to remain true to the model.Â  The first pictures of the cockpit show the progress the developers have made on this aircraft, which already makes us want to fly it!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, developer Just Flight published a short blog on the key differences between its upcoming RJ Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator and the 146 Professional for MSFS that was released almost a year ago. Through the post, Just Flight briefly introduced the most noticeable, as well as the more hidden, differences in exterior modeling and cockpit layout of the two products. Starting with the exterior, the developer pointed out that RJ Professional will feature different probe configuration, more powerful engine options, and as many as 29 new liveraries. Moving on to the cockpit, the most significant upgrades to the aircrafts can be seen. Most of the analog instruments from the HDI to the engine indicators are placed with a new suite of electronic flight instrumentation systems. The new system will also include a brand new primary flight instrument system, and navigational display. Furthermore, the cockpit will feature a digital metric altimeter, full authority digital engine control system, and a âmore capable digital flight guidance system (FGS) is controlled by the mode control panel (MCP)â Finally, the RJ Professional will be equipped with two custom-coded GNLU-910 FMSs and a new automatic pressurization system in the overhead panel. In addition to the upgrades described above, a series of more subtle changes from a reworked radio panel and yoke checklists are also added to the aircraft. A full list of changes can be checked out on Just Flightâs website. Currently, Just Flight is yet to announce a release date and pricing for the RJ Professional for MSFS. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>
