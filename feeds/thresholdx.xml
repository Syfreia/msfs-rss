    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The yearly Navigraph Survey has been released to the FlightSim community where a selection of questions will be asked based on Partnerships, Demographics, Relation to any real life aviation and much more! â The survey period lasts from today, the 18th November 2022 to the 28th November. It is a 10 day window where flight sim enthusiasts have their opinion on what they want to see in future development. â Take part in the Navigraph FlightSim Community Survey 2022 by clicking here The questions asked in the survey will be straightforward and will give you an option whether it is optional or not. You have to be honest in the survey as this is the best way developers can get an idea of what people want to see in the future. Questions can range from age, overall income and education levels to what intrigues you about FlightSim and why you spend the hours you do being part of a massive aviation community. â The 2022 survey is one of the largest surveyâs of its kind and contains a much more broad selection of simulators as well as newly arose aircraft developers. As we all know Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 has seen a massive amount of development since it was released 2 years ago by developers such as PMDG, Fenix Simulations, FlyByWire, Orbx, Aerosoft, UK2000 and much much more. A few months ago Laminar Research had released the Early Access / Beta version of X-Plane 12 which the team at Laminar have been working incredibly hard on to provide constant Beta updates for the users of X-Plane. Again this newly released simulator has seen a massive amount of development from external developers such as X-Works, Threshold, Toliss, FlightFactor, Orbx and many more. This year should give some interesting results due to the recent development on these newly released simulators. Here is a link to last years results where we saw MSFS take the lead, who will take the lead this year? Let us know below. â Unfortunately, Threshold are not shown in the partnerships in this yearâs survey. Results will be announced on Navigraphâs blog in Mid-December, the survey is anonymous and no personally identifiable information is collected, and the results will only be presented in aggregated form. â Again, to take part in the Navigraph 2022 Survey click here! â We look forward to seeing the results!</summary>

    <title>PMDG Releases SU11 Compatibility Update for 737 Lineup</title>
    <updated>2022-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has just released a new update to the 737 lineup, ensuring compatibility with Sim Update 11 and its new standards, built on the latest SDK. According to Robert RandazzoâsÂ forum announcement, the main focus has been the tuning of the control law for the automatic flight control system in pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust, mitigating an issue with the previous update related to the atmospheric stability simulation that is claimed to be âsignificantly unrealisticâ and requiring the creation of additional logic into the control law. PMDG also claims the 737 control logic improvements will pave the way towards greater realism in atmospheric stability without need for changes.Â   They have been working on bringing forward new features that are now possible with SU11, such as a weather radar, but the results are not yet up to the expected standard, thus still under development. A short list of other minor fixes follows down below: 0012072: [General - Documentation] Amend Introduction document to remove Wifi Antenna FWD/AFT option (hvanrensburg) 0012051: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Capt Stab trim clipping (vscimone) 0012052: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] MIssing pixel on Electrical Panel when using New pressurization panel option (vscimone) 0011821: [External Model - Geometry] Negative pressure relief valve text &amp; push panel mis-aligned (jbrown) 0011614: [External Model - Geometry] Paintkit Model Texture Distortion (jbrown) Work on the SU11 transition has delayed the progress on the 737-900, which they hope should be entering testing by next week. The EFB, on the other hand, is apparently well into testing and progressing well. Randazzo has mentioned that a preview will probably happen as soon as they feel itâs ready to be shown.  Regarding the marketplace addition, they claim it was submitted today to Asobo for approval, and it should become available soon.Â   The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Images are courtesy of Pineapple_Wizard.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds hasÂ recently announcedÂ their newest project for Microsoft Flight Simulator: Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (KDTW). Itâs Michiganâs busiest airport, with an average of 35 million passengers yearly, covering a massive domestic and international network, with Delta, Endeavor, and Spirit taking a chunk of the market share.Â  â According to the developers, the development of DTW took their scenery development to the next level, with a high degree of accuracy. It features custom jetways, GSE and taxi signs, high-quality textures, an animated train in the McNamara terminal, fully animated Laminar fountain, and deicing statics. âAs part of our commitment to our customers earlier in the year, with each scenery we release, we want to push the boundaries in the features we are providingâ says the developer.  They have also previewed an iniManager feature that will allow customers to customize their sceneries to their liking, such as static aircraft, people, and winter equipment. It will also be made available for their KLAX and EGLL.  There is no information on release date or pricing yet. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has made aÂ forum postÂ with updates on the development of Stockholm-Arlanda V2 (ESSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It is the largest airport in the country, with a yearly average of 26 million passengers (70% international, 30% domestic). It serves Metropolitan Stockholm and known as the gateway to most of Sweden.Â   Itâs a hub for Scandinavian Airlines and Eurowings Europe, and a focus city for Finnair, Novair, and Ryanair. London is the most popular European destination, with nearly 2 million passengers shared between Heathrow and Gatwick, followed by Copenhagen with 1,394,000. International-wise, Dubai tops the chart with 302000, followed by Doha with 284000, and the United States with 278000.  They have partnered with Jetstream Designs (creator of Paris-Orly, Toulouse, and Linate, among many others) and are âmoving forward quicklyâ, with Terminal 5 to reach completion soon. The scenery will feature custom GSE items, and high-quality ortho imagery with an updated high-res mesh, âto be showcased soonâ.Â   In regard to a potential P3D and X-Plane version, they say it will be looked at once the scenery is out, âas long as there is a market for it at that point.â  The developer made aÂ Facebook pageÂ with progress updates and screenshots.  Thereâs no information on pricing and release date yet. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! Thanks to Luke on our Discord for the scoop! â</summary>
