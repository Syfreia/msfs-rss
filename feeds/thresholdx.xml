    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, developer Verticalsim released Ontario International Airport (KONT) for X-Plane 11. The scenery, featuring PBR textures, HDR lighting, and custom ground traffic, will serve as a fantastic gateway for pilots who are planning to visit the beautiful state of California or looking for a major cargo hub to fly their new MD-11 or A300. According to the productâs store page, Verticalismâs rendition of Ontario Airport will be based on the latest layout of the airport, including the recently added Fedex ramp. The scenery will feature SAM jetways, highly detailed models, custom lighting, and âusage of LODâs for optimizationâ. For a complete list of features, check out the developerâs website. Ontario Airport, located in San Bernardino County, California, is a public airport that serves as both a passenger and cargo hub for the region, as well as the alternative landing site for LAX. It is home to airlines such as American and Delta and cargo carriers such as UPS and Fedex. In 2018, KONT saw some 5 million passengers and an average of 65 flights per day. Currently, Ontario International Airport for X-Plane 11 can be purchased on Verticalsimâs webstore for $24.99 USD, excluding any sales tax that may incur. To successfully install the product, users must download the SAM plugin and have at least 3.51GB of free space on their hard drive.</summary>

    <title>PMDG 737 for MSFS Enters the "Home Stretch"</title>
    <updated>2022-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmdg41" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6253da417c450e0a47cc1efe_image_15778.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="437320"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Robert Randazzo at PMDG SimulationsÂ has taken to the developer's forumsÂ to give more insight into the 737 for MSFS development progress. The team is nearing the end of the initial testing phase of the 737-700 and will hold a meeting next week to finalize the release date. (the above photos are sourced from PMDG's March 15th 737 update) Contextual Information PMDG intends on including the MAX product line to complement the Next Generation products. The initial release product will be the PMDG 737-700, which will consist of the passenger, cargo, and BBJ variants of the aircraft, featuring a multitude of winglet styles, configurable options, and PMDG's classic realism. The team will release an additional variant of the 737 product line in approximately six-week intervals, including 737-600, 737-800, and 737-900 for MSFS.Â  "Customer Driven Ideas" Every 737 variant will be sold separately to allow customers more flexibility to acquire the models they desire instead of purchasing variants in a large package. Another idea touted by customers was that the team intends to treat the release phase of the 737 as if it was early access. Most features will initially be available in the aircraft, but a few features won't be possible to delegate to the product line until the product releases. These product updates will be available in two-week intervals during the initial 24 week release period.Â  Features That'll Be Added After Release or Excluded Altogether. The aforementioned updates will be available to users at no cost via updates to the products.Â  What's Included in the 737 Products? Essentially, the aircraft will contain numerous features, with customized performance data, accurate flight modeling, complete flight management, realistic autopilot, and functioning LNAV, VNAV. "How is the performance?" Performance "remains quite good" the 737 should run fine if your setup can already handle other third-party aircraft. Randazzo's rig, featuring an early i9 and 2080Ti, can run the 737 well at default airports. He provided Drzewiecki Design's RNT as an example, which offers 40-45fps with the 737 in-sim, and default airports such as FMEE provide mid-to-low 50s.Â Â  Discounts Users should not expect any discount/trade-in or upgrade programs for the 737 product line, except for one scenario. If you purchased the 737 NGXu for P3D when the team offered a transition program for those who desired to buy the MSFS 737 at release, you would receive a $99.99 credit towards purchasing the 737 MSFS product line. This credit offer only applies to those who purchased the NGXu before December 31st, 2019.Â  Product Pricing is TBA at the Moment Final Thoughts Robert has shifted his focus to recording some videos to showcase the aircraft's depth and features (PMDGs YouTube channel). He mentions that this series will not be a tutorial but rather "serve as small bites of information that will allow you to quickly see the depth of features available to you as a PMDG 737 product line user." Beta testers will be able to share information and media about the upcoming aircraft beginning of next week.Â  As we all await the forthcoming news from PMDG in the coming weeks, stay tuned with Threshold as we report on all the news originating from the simulator world.Â </summary>

After the war, the Norwegian Air Force took over operations and began adding expansions to the airport. Years later, the Norwegian Parliament approved construction for public passenger services, with the airport opening to the public on the 14th of September, 1964. The team has included a small, but down to the point feature list. Starting, the team has accurately modeled the surrounding area and the airport grounds, alongside accurate terraforming and CGLÂ data.

    <title>PMDG On Approach to Release for 737-700; Remains Tight-Lipped On Release Date</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG is reaching the end of the tunnel in the development of their hotly-awaited 737-700NG3. On their forums, Robert Randazzo detailed that the team remains bullish for a timely release, but is still reserved on setting a concrete release date due to several factors adding âambiguityâ to the projectâs completion, and the upcoming Sim Update 9 from Asobo additionally brings more uncertainty to the add-onâs stability with potential issues that is unforeseeable. Randazzo explained that a lot of logistics are involved in preparation for enabling the team to adapt to SU9, one of which is ensuring a stable testing environment to avoid a ânegative initial user experienceâ. A lot of details are yet to be finalised, including the release date which not even the team has a concrete answer internally, there is an âentire evaluative processâ taking place to pinpoint a date. That said, RSR reassured that the productâs launch will not be a surprise drop in store, a release date with possibly an approximate time of day will be announced prior to the release. As the team approaches the final leg of the 737-700âs development, Randazzo optimistically said that things will become much more exciting between now and the productâs release. The embargo will be lifted so testers of the add-on can share and provide additional new insights into the product, streamers who got ahold of the aircraft will have their embargo lifted as the plane is released.Â  To kickstart the beginning of the hype building, the team is currently releasing a series of walkthrough videos on the 737-700 on their YouTube channel, with an introductory video published already (embedded on top). A few hours ago, another video is published detailing the Tow Out and plans after the release of the aircraft: More videos will steadily be published in the coming days and weeks. Moving on, Randazzo has shifted to discussing the sounds that are developed for the add-on. Armen, who is principally behind the soundset, has been developing a âsound-scapeâ to match the visuals and systems fidelity of the rest of the aircraft. Stressing that the sound engine that MSFS used is âunlike anything they have every[sic] had the opportunity to work withâ, to which Armen has used the engine to its full potential. Randazzo wraps up the update by assuring that this will be a monumental release, both for the team and the flight sim community; the talent behind Vin and Jason to develop the most visually, and technically faithful 737 for MSFS combined with the delightful sonic experience from Armen that brings the bird to life.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, PMDG published a lengthy blog, detailing its plans for the release of its much anticipated 737NG series for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Through the blog, the developers explained in detail the Early Adopter model they will utilize for their upcoming products and outlined a general release plan for its 737s. According to PMDG, the Early Adopter model will be implemented for the first time to give the developers additional time to fully master the new technologies brought by MSFS, allowing them to gradually implement features that they couldnât provide in the past. In the Early Adopter Period that starts with the initial release of the -700, ânew features, bug fixes, model and texture improvements, performance optimizations, and increasing MSFS integration will be rolled out in update intervals spaced approximately two weeks apartâ. During this time, the -600, -800, and -900 will also be released, with new updates being made available to all four variants simultaneously. In total, the developers expect this period to run a total of 24 weeks, ending around 6 weeks after the release of the -900, though it may be extended if needed. The developers stressed that the airplanes will be fully functional during this time and this period will enable them to âexpand it beyond the initial capabilities deliveredâ. Additionally, PMDG will be providing a list of features that it will add/optimize, including ones that are currently unachievable due to SDK limitations. The list will be kept up-to-date with the roll out of each new version.Â  After the Early Adopter Phase, the aircraft will enter the continued maintenance phase where PMDG will shift focus away from developing new features and instead provide regular compatibility/stability updates, turning to the development of its next product - the 777 series for MSFS. Currently, PMDG has not yet announced a firm release date or pricing for the 737NG series. However the developers stressed that the Early Adopter phase will not affect the price of the aircraft. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>
