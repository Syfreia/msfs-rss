    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SLH Sim Designs has just released their rendition of Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport (TUPJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the main airport serving the British Virgin Islands, and previously known as Beef Island Airport. Itâs a gateway to other smaller islands in the archipelago and a bridge away from the main island (Tortola).Â   It underwent a Major renovation in 2004, which included a runway expansion to allow operation of larger airplanes. It also added a new 4300 square meter terminal building, an enlarged flight apron, a new control tower, and 150 extra parking stalls.Â   Itâs served by many regional airlines such as Air Sunshine, Cape Air, LIAT, Silver Airways, VI Airlink, and Winair. American Eagle set to begin flying to Terrance B. Lettsome in June 2023 from Miami. Curiously, there is a $20 departure tax for anyone above the age of 5.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport with modeled interiors for the terminal and tower, accurate terraforming and runway slope, dynamic night lighting, animated road traffic with functional toll gates, true-to-life airport landside recreation, custom taxiway and signage lighting, and 4K PBR textures.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.81, requiring at least 272 MB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MXI Design has just released their rendition of Doha Hamad International Airport (OTHH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in Qatar with a yearly average of 36 million passengers. Opened in 2014, it replaces Doha International Airport as Qatarâs main airport, built on 22 square kilometers of land and able to handle 320,000 aircraft movements and 2 million tonnes of cargo per year. DOH is the first Middle Eastern airport to get the Skytrax's World Best Airport award (2021 and 2022), ending a nearly decade-long streak of Singaporeâs Changi. â Itâs the hub for Qatar Airways, with a route network that covers most of the globe, from their next-door neighbors of Abu Dhabi to San Francisco. Such high coverage makes it so other carriers donât have much of a financially logical reason to fly to Doha, but there are still a couple of them such as Air Canada, Air India, British Airways, Conviasa, Finnair, and Malaysia Airlines. The scenery features a high-detail recreation of the airport, with an updated ground layout, high-quality ground markings and buildings, PBR textures, custom clutter objects, a basic terminal interior with the World Cup theming, 3D passengers, animated passenger train inside the terminal building, custom jetways, Qatar Airways hangar with an animated door, animated RGB road masts and flags, and support for the Aerosoft VDGS system. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $21.07, requiring at least 1.4 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published anotherÂ development updateÂ on their Fokker F28 Fellowship for Microsoft Flight Simulator, showcasing the lighting (internally and externally) in a 3 minute long video around an Air Anglia F28-4000. According to the developers, there are 50 dynamic lights covering the exterior, cabin, and cockpit.Â   The Fokker F28 Fellowship is a twin-engined regional jet developed in the late 60s, with its first flight in 1967 and introduced in 1969, with 241 units built after a 20 year run (production ended in 1987). Multiple variants were developed, with the F28-1000 seating up to 70 passengers, the F28-2000 housing 79 people, and the later revision, the F28-4000, featuring quieter engines (Rolls-Royce Spey 555-15H), a redesigned cockpit and modified wings, and increased seating (up to 85 passengers). It was then superseded by the Fokker 70 and 100.Â   As of 2019, there are no current operators of the F28 around, with Fly-SAX being the last to operate it commercially. Garuda Indonesia was the largest former operator, with 62 of them. Other Major operators include the Ansett Group (13), AirQuarius Aviation (4), and Biman Bangladesh Airlines (4). The Ansett Group was also responsible for the longest nonstop F28 route in the world, between Perth and Kununurra, roughly 2300 km apart.Â   Thereâs no information on release date or pricing yet.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has just released their rendition of the Curtiss P-40F Warhawk for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a single-engined classic fighter first flown in 1938. It was the third most produced American fighter in WW2, with 13,738 units by the end of the production cycle in late 1944, playing an important role during the war, used by most allied powers.   From the hot and dry Deserts of the Middle East to the dampness of Europe, the Warhawk has been everywhere in WW2, with over 200 allied fighter pilots becoming aces flying the P-40. It remained in active use well after the War, by Brazil, Egypt, Finland, and Turkey. The Brazilian Air Force was the last to retire their fleet, in 1954. The iniBuilds P-40F features the latest in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) implementation from Microsoft, including the primary flight surfaces, control surfaces, and the propeller, with an authentically modeled Merlin engine which performs close to real-life figures (with feedback from type-rated pilots), a fully modeled fuel system, an electronic flight bag with maintenance page, moving map, radios, and weather information. The complete feature list follows down below: â The airplane is available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $18.43, requiring at least 2.99 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

Rebuilding work started in 1948, with regular traffic returning in the beginning of the second half of that year.Â   The current terminal building finished in 1992, with its first expansion happening in 2000 (and the inclusion of jetways). The runway underwent renovation work in 2016, with new pavement and LED lights, and 2019 marked the completion of the terminalâs third enlargement.  The scenery update added conditional visibility to the winter objects, smoke effects for cold weather, glass improvements, and general fixes.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recentlyÂ announcedÂ the development of Oslo Gardermoen Airport (ENGM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in Norway, nearing 30 million passengers per year with almost 200 destinations. Itâs home to Flyr, Norse Atlantic Airways, and Wideroe.Â   The airportâs history dates back to 1740 when the Norwegian army used Gardermoen (then Fredericksfeldt) as a camp. It remained as such until 1860, when barracks and stalls were constructed to house more people and protect against the harsh weather. Insulated buildings were the next logical upgrade, in the early 1900s. It became an airport in 1912 when the first of many flights took off.Â   Gardermoen was taken over by the nazis during the German occupation in 1940, building the first aircraft facilities and two runways with 2,000 meters each. The Norwegian Air Force took it back as soon as WW2 ended, housing three fighter squadrons. In 1946, Braathens SAFE used the facilities as their technical base, which only lasted for two years. It was also during that period when Oslo Gardermoen became the reserve airport for Fornebu, which used to be the main airport. All the intercontinental flights were redirected to OSL because Fornebu was undergoing runway extension work. It wasnât until 1998 that Gardermoen became the main airport in Oslo.  The scenery will feature custom orthoimagery, PBR textures in 4K, interior modeling, 3 different types of animated jetways to match the real world, fully functioning VDGS on all appropriate gates, custom ground service equipment, and optimization work to warrant good performance.  It is allegedly coming in January 2023, priced at roughly $21.00. Thereâs no information on the install size yet. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
