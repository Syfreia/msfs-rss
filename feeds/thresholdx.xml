    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Taimodels has recently released their rendition of Cairns Airport (YBCS) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving the city of Cairns in Queensland, Australia, with a yearly average of 5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1936 on 162 hectares of land bought by the Cairns City Council, originally sporting three runways made of cinders, red earth, weathered rock, and sand. Then, in the early 1940s, the Australian Government purchased the airport to adapt it for RAF use, paving and lengthening the main runway to comport larger aircraft. â  Twenty years later, the airport was upgraded to receive jet aircraft, with an expansion and a runway extension followed by extensive flattening. â With the ever-growing passenger traffic figures, there was pressure in the late 1970s to expand the passenger terminal, which went on to happen in 1982. Finished two years later, it was just the first stage of three. The whole ordeal ended in 1997 with the conclusion of a three-story Airport Administration Center. â In 2007, the domestic terminal was redeveloped, costing the administration around 200 million Australian Dollars.Â  â The last upgrade started in 2019 and was completed a year later, increasing the departure hall area and adding dining and retail facilities. Itâs part of their plan to prepare the airport for handling up to 6 million passengers annually from 2027. â In early 2023, they announced the first major upgrade to the international terminal, rolling out in stages to minimize passenger disruption.  â Itâs a hub for QantasLink and Skytrans Airlines and served by Air New Zealand, Air Niugini, Airnorth, Alliance Airlines, Asia Pacific Airlines, Bonza, Hinterland Aviation, Jetstar, PNG Air, Qantas, Rex Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Virgin Australia. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail models, SAM jetways, PBR texturing, custom autogen, ground traffic plugins, and weather textures (XP12).Â  â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.18, requiring at least 1.51 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RFscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Zagreb Franjo TuÄman Airport (LDZA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Croatian city of Zagreb with a yearly average of 3.1 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1962, replacing an airfield near the village of LuÄko. It originally featured a 2,500-meter runway with a 1000 square meter terminal, replaced within three years by a state-of-the-art 5000 square meter terminal. The runway was lengthened to its current capacity in 1974. â The airport was upgraded in the early 2000s with an ILS system and a terminal expansion, adding 10,000 square meters to its total area, and it was later expanded even further in 2017 with the construction of a brand new, 70,000 square meter terminal, increasing its yearly passenger handling capabilities to 5.5 million passengers. â Itâs a hub for Croatia Airlines and one of the European bases for Ryanair. Aegean Airlines, Air France, Air Serbia, Air Transat, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Eurowings, Finnair, flydubai, Iberia, KLM, LOT, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Qatar Airways, Trade Air, Turkish Airlines, and Vueling also serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom buildings, custom clutter and vehicles, custom lighting, and custom jetways. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.99, requiring at least 391.58 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Jacksonville International Airport (KJAX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 6,500,000 passengers.  Jacksonville International was conceived as a replacement for Imeson Field, which has served Jacksonville since 1927. It was simply not big enough to handle the increased demand for air travel, and the runways could not be expanded due to terrain limitations.Â  â The airport's growth could have been faster, with only two million passengers annually by 1982 (way below expectation). However, the 90s saw a massive increase, with the average hitting the 5 million mark. In 2000, they approved an expansion plan to rebuild the landside terminal, central square, main concessions area, and a parking area expansion. â In 2006, they rolled out the second phase of the expansion program, rebuilding concourses A and C, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills. The crisis of 2009 stopped any other ongoing expansion work, with the old Concourse B being demolished and only considered for rebuilding ten years later when the traffic figures were healthy again. The pandemic, though, halted that project. â Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Silver Airways, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. American, Delta, and Southwest hold most of the market share, with 20% each. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom lighting, high-detail models, and performance-friendly optimization.  â It's available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $17.78, requiring at least 5.89 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently released their rendition of ChÃ¢lons Vatry Airport (LFOK) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving the champagne region in Northeastern France and close enough to Paris (135km) to be considered by Ryanair as one of the Parisian airports, with a yearly average of 61,826 passengers as of 2018.  It was built as an air base in 1953, housing fifty fighters in 3 large hangars. With France withdrawing from the integrated NATO structure in 1967, the Americans left the base, leading to its closure. The French Air Force then used it for training until the early 2000s, when it was sold to civil interests and converted into a civilian airport.  Besides handling occasional passenger traffic, itâs also a training pilot site for many airlines, such as Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, KLM, Transavia, Transavia France, and Swiss. Its relatively long runway has also seen use by Airbus for aircraft testing.  Itâs served by Ryanair, with flights to Marrakech and Porto.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with up-to-date orthoimagery, 4K PBR textures, custom HD forests and vegetation, 3D volumetric grass, 3D people, 2023 layout, custom dynamic lighting, dynamic weather effects (X-Plane 12 only), and custom ground markings.  Itâs available on theirÂ websiteÂ for roughly $14.75, requiring at least 2.8 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has released an update on their upcoming Avro Vulcan for Microsoft Flight Simulator via their website today. The Avro Vulcan, developed by Avro/Hawker Siddeley, is a British bomber that took its first flight in August 1952. The Vulcan, also known as the V bomber, was developed as part of the British atomic weapon program, designed as a medium-range bomber with the capability of carrying one 10,000 lb. bomb over a distance of 1,500 NM. It can also carry standard bomb loads of up to 20,000 LBS.  The Vulcan's iconic shape is attributed to its delta wing design, which provides stability without the need for a horizontal stabilizer. The original Vulcan was powered by the Rolls Royce Olympus 201/301 low bypass turbojet engine, capable of producing up to 20,000 pounds of thrust and enabling the Vulcan to reach speeds of up to 561 knots with a service ceiling of 55,000 Feet. The aircraft was in service with the Royal Air Force until October 2015, when it was officially retired. Just Flight is focusing on the Vulcan B Mk. 2 XM655, which is located in Wellesbourne Airfield. The simulation will include air-to-air refueling and maritime radar reconnaissance variants that were once used by the Royal Air Force. This progress update provides information on the progress made on the project by Just Flight. To ensure the Vulcan's unique engine sounds are perfect, Just Flight is "holding back" on the sound preview video. The team has made significant improvements on the interior and exterior lighting and other functionalities of the EFB app. The accuracy of the aircraft lighting has been improved by up to 20 controls in the cockpit using new reference material. Eight switches on the right console will control the exterior lighting, including air-to-air refueling, probe lighting, rotating beacons, and other indicational lighting.  The EFB has new features and user interface improvements, such as a configuration menu that allows for the toggling of various aircraft equipment. Fuel menus let you see quantities without using MSFS menus, and they also include options to control Air to Air Refueling. The radio system is also being worked on to improve operational flow for the user. The Vulcan's complex radio system will be streamlined for better usage in the sim.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Eyevionics, a new entrant into the home cockpit space, has been announced. Intended to integrate with MSFS, it brings multiple facets of a glass cockpit to mobile devices like the iPad. Â  â Addressing the lack of any proper glass cockpit solution for MSFS on external monitors, Eyevionics integrates many aspects of the cockpit into one, such as the PFD, MFD, and EFIS. According to the appâs creator, Fabian Lauer, the goal for Eyevionics is âto start an app on one, two, three devices, set up its user interface for the flight you want to fly with a few touches and then just go fly.â  Eyevionics is still in active development, but boasts an ever-growing list of features already implemented into the app, which include: â Many features are still under development for the app, such as: â Eyevionics is planned to release initially with support for iOS, as well as Android tablets, and expect to release sometime in 2024.  For more information, and further announcements, visit eyevionics.eu, or their X (formerly Twitter) account here.  â As of the time of writing, no pricing information has been announced, but Threshold will keep you informed as announcements come out about this exciting new entrant into the home cockpit space! </summary>

    <title>Orbx Releases Idahoâs âNot So Deadly 3â Pack for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-11-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/654ce6042d7cc0b98829ae75_ns3.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="1131321"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released a new set of backcountry airstrips: Cabin Creek, Wilson Bar, and Marble Creek, all in Idaho. The ânot so deadlyâ name alludes to the previously released - and much deadlier - Deadly 3.Â   Cabin CreekÂ is in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, with an airstrip surface susceptible to water and prop wash erosion. Measures were taken to minimize water erosion, such as installing water bars, but it hasnât mitigated the erosive effect of prop wash. Itâs a 1,750-foot-long dirt strip, requiring proficiency in mountain flying due to the challenging nature of the surroundings.  Wilson BarÂ is a simple turf strip with 1,500ft of total length. It is very close to the MacKay Bar airstrip and their campground.  Marble CreekÂ has a 1,160-foot-long bumpy strip, with soft sandy soil for the first 400 feet on runway 4, followed by large bumps that reduce braking effectiveness. A hill on the south end of the runway will make it hard to land on 04, and runway 22 is over a large hill. Itâs short, challenging, and surrounded by tricky terrain.  Developed by Milo Taylor, who also made the Deadly 3 and McCall Municipal Airport, the pack features three landing spots with varying degrees of difficulty, with an extensive vegetation library, new animated animals and birds, new effects, and more.  The scenery is available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $12.77, requiring at least 1 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>
