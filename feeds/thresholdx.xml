    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Rafael NÃºÃ±ez International Airport (SKCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Cartagena, Colombia, with a yearly average of 7.2 million passengers.  It was built in 1946 as Crespo Air Field, with TACA Colombia being the first airline to serve the city, albeit very briefly, as they went under a year later, with LANSA taking the remaining slots.  By 1979, the airport averaged around 99 flights a week, which was not enough in terms of touristic volume for the local hotels, leading to pressure for an airport redevelopment in 1982: a new passenger terminal and a runway extension, allowing for bigger aircraft. It is now the fourth busiest airport in the country.  Itâs a hub for Avianca and served by Air Century, American Airlines, Arajet, Avianca Costa Rica, Clic, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Edelweiss Air, JetBlue, KLM, Latam Colombia, Latam Peru, Spirit, Wingo.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, high-detail buildings, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.37, requiring at least 1.21 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Kiss Simulation has recently released their rendition of Sarajevo International Airport (LQSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers.  It was built in 1966 and opened for traffic three years later, although domestically. International operations only started a year later, with Frankfurt being its first international destination.Â   The first renovation happened nearly 20 years later for the 1984 Winter Olympics, with a new terminal building, a runway extension, and navigational system improvements.  The terminal was expanded in 2017, with a new 10,000-square-meter building able to handle up to 2 million passengers a year.  Its mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather have led to multiple financial losses over the years, with the most memorable one dating back to December 2015, when over 40% of the flights were canceled. The only way they could fix it would be by moving the threshold an additional 200 meters, which would shorten the runway, which is not ideal given that itâs already relatively short at 2,600 meters.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with the new terminal extension, custom runway profile, real-world ILS profile, custom-made ground textures, up-to-date ground layout, runway weathering, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.18, requiring at least 792.15 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cockspur has announced the release of their PH100 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Known for their light business jets and general aviation aircraft in MSFS, Cockspur has now unveiled the PH100, an rendition of the Embraer Phenom 100. Their recent release of the Cessna Citation Mustang garnered popularity from the Microsoft Flight Simulator community, and anticipation for the PH100 has been building steadily. This project started as a side endeavor right after the Mustang release but was kept under wraps until an intriguing teaser trailer was unveiled in early December 2022. Recent beta testing, marked by live streams offering glimpses of the development progress and features, has further stoked the excitement. The PH100 has become one of the most eagerly awaited aircraft in the MSFS community, with Cockspur teasing its release date via their Facebook page just this week. In the real world, the Embraer Phenom 100 is a significant player in the corporate jet market. Manufactured by the renowned Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer, the Phenom 100 is classified as a VLJ (Very Light Jet), with its larger sibling being the 300E. The Phenom 100 made its maiden flight on July 26, 2008, and has since achieved immense success, becoming one of the most popular light jets on the market. A new configuration of the Phenom will set you back approximately $3 million, and with over 400 units produced, it boasts a strong presence in the aviation world. Cockspur has recreated this popular aircraft within Microsoft Flight Simulator, offering a plethora of features that faithfully replicate its real-world counterpart. These features include Garmin G1000NXi avionics with a custom FADEC system, meticulously replicated switches, and authentic functionality to provide a true-to-life piloting experience. Dynamic systems bring the experience of managing and operating the Phenom's unique systems, closely mirroring the real-world aircraft. Flight dynamics have been finely tuned based on feedback from actual Phenom pilots, enhancing the overall immersion of flying the PH100. The visual modeling is equally impressive, with accurate 3D modeling, animations, and texturing that add to the overall authenticity. The PH100 package includes 11 liveries, with support for FS2020's dynamic registration system. Additionally, a paint kit is included, allowing users to create their custom liveries or recreate their favorite designs. To ensure a smooth download experience, Cockspur recommends using a download manager, especially during high server loads. Additionally, they suggest utilizing the recently released Simstaller by Parallel 42 (//42). The PH100 is available for purchase through the Cockspur store, priced at 26.99 â¬ / 29.48 $.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has shared more previews of their upcoming BrasÃ­lia - President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR), the third busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. The airport was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. A proper terminal building was inaugurated in 1971, designed by TÃ©rcio Fontana Pacheco, a Brazilian Air Force architect. The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more, divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. The upcoming scenery is said to feature animated moving walkways, an up-to-date ground layout, terminal interiors, custom jetways, detailed landside, and more.  Thereâs no release date yet, but itâs said to be âalmost there.âStay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx's recently announced Gold Coast Airport (YBCG) is on "short final," according to a development update in their forum, bringing an up-to-date rendition of the seventh busiest airport in Australia to Microsoft Flight Simulator. It was built in 1936, consisting of three grass strips whose sole intent was to provide an emergency landing spot for aircraft flying between Brisbane and Sydney, with passenger service only beginning three years later. Regular service was only to begin after WW2, with Queensland Airlines and Butler Air Transport, followed by Ansett in 1950 and Trans Australia Airlines in 1954. Taxiways and runways were fully paved by 1958, allowing for the operation of larger, heavier aircraft such as the DC-9 and L-188 Electra. The current passenger terminal was opened in 1981 by Acting Prime Minister Douglas Anthony. The following year saw the main runway extended to 2,042 meters, allowing for the operation of wide-body jet aircraft. It was later extended to 2,500 meters sometime in 2007. The passenger terminal was upgraded in 2010, with an expansion that doubled its total size, accommodating a decade's worth of growth in passenger volume. It was then expanded again in 2016, 2019, and 2022, with a 30,000-square-meter expansion and overall infrastructure modernization. It's a hub for Bonza. AirAsia X, Air New Zealand, Eastern Air Services, Jetstar, Qantas, QantasLink, Rex Airlines, Seair Pacific, and Virgin Australia serve it regularly. Developed by Matteo Veneziani, the scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, 4K textures, an interior on the main terminal, unique GSE vehicles, dynamic airport lighting, custom ground textures, custom animated jetways, performance-friendly optimization, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently announced the development of Gladstone Airport (YGLA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Gladstone in Queensland (Australia) with a yearly average of 240,000 passengers (as of 2011). It was built on a bulldozed airstrip in 1953, with work completed in 1956 and its official opening in 1957, although it had been frequently used a few months prior.  Nowadays, itâs owned and operated by the Gladstone Regional Council, which took the helm after the former owner (Gladstone-Calliope Aerodrome Board) was dissolved in 2007.   Bonza, QantasLink, and Virgin Australia currently serve it with flights to Brisbane, Gold Coast, and Melbourne.  â The scenery will feature an up-to-date ground layout, custom runway and taxiway light models, and more. â Thereâs still no information on pricing or a potential release date.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <title>Black Square Publishes Development Update on the Dukes for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Black Square has recently published a new development update on their rendition of the Piston Duke and Turbine Duke for Microsoft Flight Simulator, modeled after the Beechcraft 60 Duke and BLR Performance Innovation's Grand Duke package, respectively.  The Beechcraft 60 Duke is a twin-engine fixed-wing aircraft first flown in 1966 and introduced in 1968, with 596 built during its fifteen years of production. Black Square's rendition uses the 1974 model as a reference (when the B60 variant was introduced with interior arrangement renovations and engine efficiency tweaks). It's powered by two Lycoming TIO541-E1C4 engines, developing 380 hp each, cruising at 330 km/h, with a service ceiling of 30,000ft and 1,227nm of range at 20,000ft with 45% power.  The Grand Duke package, on the other hand, adds 190 pounds of useful load, a 350 fpm increase in climb rate with winglets, and significantly lower approach speeds. The vortex generators are also said to make a dramatic difference in the aircraft's flight characteristics, considerably improving its safety may an emergency arise. Nick Cyganski, the developer, has spent months developing "countless new features" that were never seen before in Microsoft Flight Simulator, some of which shall make their way into older Black Square products in the near future. The first of these features is the new in-cockpit EFB tablet, claimed to be the most complete interface yet for monitoring systems in the simulator. It includes an option configuration, payload and fuel manager, live electrical schematic, and failure options.   Their goal was the creation of real-time graphical representations of some of the most complex systems in general aviation aircraft, allowing both experienced and novice pilots to understand an aircraft's intricacies. The Piston Duke (B60) will feature a reciprocating engine simulation, completely overhauling the engine start procedure and propeller feathering, along with the pre-existing fouling, vapor lock, flooding, backfire, and turbocharger simulations already present in their previous products. The crankshaft is driven by the physics of cylinder compression, fuel ignition, propeller drag, and friction throughout, and the engine oil pressure drives the propeller feathering, as in real life.  It will also feature instrument stiction and friction physics, with needles that can get temporarily stuck and unstuck with the engine vibration. Alternatively, one can tap on the gauges to get the needles to unstick.  The sounds were developed in partnership with Boris Audio Works, ensuring a high-quality sound floor on both variants.  Regarding navigation, it will feature the freeware KLN-90B GPS Navigator, along with support for the PMS GTN650 and TDS GTN650Xis, with 12 hot-swapping avionics combinations in total.   Beta testing has already started, and they plan to release the airplanes in March 2024. They will be available separately and in a discounted bundle, with a PDF user manual and a series of videos on Just Flights' YouTube channel.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently announced the development of Anacortes Airport (74S) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a public-use airport serving Anacortes, Washington, with a yearly average of 9,000 aircraft operations. It was built in 1968 and inaugurated in 1969 on land purchased by the Port of Anacortes using FAA grant money. Itâs included in FAAâs National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017-2021 as a local general aviation facility, corresponding to 73% of its yearly traffic as of 2014. Air taxis make up the other 17%.  â Developed by Andreas Hegi, the scenery was completely rebuilt for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with a 3D terminal interior, custom PBR textures, an accurate ground layout, custom airport signs and markings, and more.  Thereâs no information on the release date or pricing yet. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>
