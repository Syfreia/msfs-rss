    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, scenery developer LHSimulations released Budapest International Airport v2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport, equipped with everything from detailed ortho to high quality PBR textures, will provide sim-pilots with a gateway into the historical city and the country of Hungary itself. According to the developers, Budapest v2 will feature the latest layout of the airport, including a brand new cargo area furnished with aprons and hangers. In addition, the airport will also house functional jetways and âhigh resolution photobackgroundâ for maximum immersion.  Finally, LHSimulations has promised to bring an array of improvements through future updates from performance patches to custom air traffic. For a full list of features, check out LHSimulations webstore.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After having developed the A310 for MSFS, iniBuilds announces the continuation of its partnership with MSFS with two new aircraft under development: The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny and the Grumman G-21A Goose. Both aircraft will be 100% free and developed exclusively for MSFS. In a forum post, the CEO of iniBuilds is pleased to announce the continuation of their partnership with MSFS with these two historic aircraft under development. The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny, was a military training aircraft with production starting in 1915. After the end of the First World War, there was a surplus of aircraft that became civilian aircraft in 1918. From then on, the JN-4 became a very popular trainer for solo training flights, for the civilian market. It is therefore a historic aircraft full of adventure and history that iniBuilds is developing for a modern simulator, more than 100 years after the real-life Curtiss JN-4 Jenny was released. The second aircraft under development, the Grumman G-21A Goose, has a different story. Originally, it was a group of Long Islanders who wanted a business aircraft to fly to and from New York. So they approached Grumman. Following discussions, Grumman converted the Grumman Goose and that's how the G-21A was born, in around 1936. The G-21A was later upgraded to carry 8 passengers and fly military missions all over the world. iniBuilds has endeavoured to reproduce this atmosphere in the aircraft cabin with a bar, champagne bucket and restroom facilities to remain true to the model.Â  The first pictures of the cockpit show the progress the developers have made on this aircraft, which already makes us want to fly it!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, developer Just Flight published a short blog on the key differences between its upcoming RJ Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator and the 146 Professional for MSFS that was released almost a year ago. Through the post, Just Flight briefly introduced the most noticeable, as well as the more hidden, differences in exterior modeling and cockpit layout of the two products. Starting with the exterior, the developer pointed out that RJ Professional will feature different probe configuration, more powerful engine options, and as many as 29 new liveraries. Moving on to the cockpit, the most significant upgrades to the aircrafts can be seen. Most of the analog instruments from the HDI to the engine indicators are placed with a new suite of electronic flight instrumentation systems. The new system will also include a brand new primary flight instrument system, and navigational display. Furthermore, the cockpit will feature a digital metric altimeter, full authority digital engine control system, and a âmore capable digital flight guidance system (FGS) is controlled by the mode control panel (MCP)â Finally, the RJ Professional will be equipped with two custom-coded GNLU-910 FMSs and a new automatic pressurization system in the overhead panel. In addition to the upgrades described above, a series of more subtle changes from a reworked radio panel and yoke checklists are also added to the aircraft. A full list of changes can be checked out on Just Flightâs website. Currently, Just Flight is yet to announce a release date and pricing for the RJ Professional for MSFS. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The team behind the popular X-Plane addon xEnviro have released an update on what's in store regarding the project's future development.Â  âIn a forum post this evening, head of development Magnus has outlined future plans for the project along with reasons behind the perhaps seemingly slow development of version 1.17 â It has been revealed that xEnviro will not be released during the Beta phase of X-Plane 12. Magnus provides us with the reasoning behind this;Â  âxEnviro will not be released in this Beta run.Â Laminar Research has closed off all access to the platform by not giving access to the 3D draw callback, depth buffer and so on. X-Plane 11 was already limiting us and thus demanded a lot on performance to work. Especially when Vulkan was released, and our dynamic seasons got abruptly cut off. âÂ  Magnus goes on to further state; âHowever. We are in a dialogue with Austin on the matter, and I am optimistic that we will find a solution to our limited access so that we can release 1.18 in XP12. Regardless of when this access is given, we must finish 1.17 in XP11.â New features expected in version 1.17 of xEnviro include;Â  Magnus has disclosed that they are currently rebuilding the beta testing team and while he is not in a position to provide a time frame he provides us with in update in stating âWeâre at the final stretch before the chicanes that lead to the finish lineâ We will keep you update on the development of xEnviro V1.17 as it progresses.  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Flyingron Simulations released its long-anticipated F6F Hellcat, adding to its ever-growing war-bird hangar. In WWII, the Grumman Hellcat served primarily as a NAVY bird on aircraft carriers. It replaced the F4F Wildcat to take on the A6M Zero. The Hellcat later became one of the top performing combat aircraft of the war gaining over 5,000 kills by the end of World War II. Flyingiron has brought the Hellcats legacy to Microsoft Flight Simulator with meticulous attention to detail. Flyingiron has also gained recognition for its Spitfire and P-58 models developed for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â The F6F-5 HELLCAT is for sale for the reasonable price of $45 AUD.  â The model is well detailed and handcrafted, taking over six months to complete. A few notable features include attention to aircraft systems and thermodynamics, factors to be considered in terms of wear and tear, and power plant management. Expect a learning curve when flying the Hellcat, which will challenge your manual flying skills. The F6F will be an exciting aircraft to switch to if you are used to flying today's modern birds. Usability features include a virtual tablet with customization options, maintenance, live aircraft monitoring, and more.Â  For a complete list of features including the product manual, check out the Hellcat product page here on the Flyingiron Simulations site. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. DC Designs have posted a news update to their Facebook page detailing requested features from several customers. One such request from customers is if the Harrier could bow as it does in real-life air displays, as seen in this video. Here is the response. â Â âI had not had the chance to test this until recently, and yesterday was able to give it a go. The answer was: yes you can! However, to balance the Harrier while performing the bow and not climb, drift, or descend is really difficult even in light winds. The aircraftâs engine thrust responds to N2, which means there is a lag between adding or removing power, and the thrust altering to climb or descend in the hover, which complicates things even further.â Check out more test footage of the Harrier here. The developer also dropped hints of a "Secret projectâ within the post. Just today the project was announced via Facebook as a partnership with a new developer âCJ Simulations". The pair are working together in bringing the Eurofighter Typhoon to FS2020.Â  This will be a well detailed model with a fully operational cockpit. The Typhoon will have a custom flight model simulating its unique delta canard system. You can expect many liveries and visual aerodynamic effects to be featured with this fighter as well. DC Designs also released a video displaying the Typhoon's maneuverability, aerodynamic effects, and modeling details! The Eurofighter is slated to be released in October for PC and XBox. Weâre looking forward to these releases. DC Designs is known for their awesome fighter aircraft for FS2020, especially the F-14 Tomcat. Weâll keep you updated with more information here at Threshold! â</summary>
