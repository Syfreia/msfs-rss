    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Darwin International Airport (YPDN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the tenth busiest airport in Australia with a yearly average of 2.0 million passengers.  Darwin Airport started as Parap Airfield in 1919, operating as a civilian and military field. It played an important role during WW2, used by the Allies to project air power into the Pacific. Soon after the war, the military airfield part was made available to civilian traffic, and the former civilian part was closed down.  A new passenger terminal was made in 1991, increasing the passenger handling capabilities of the then-primary domestic and international airport of the Northern Territory. It wasnât until 2015 that it got massively expanded. An 85 million Australian dollar expansion project brought the terminal from 16,000 to 27,000 square meters, with new airline lounges, more check-in stands, and six boarding gates.Â   The airport is served by Airnorth (Alice Springs, Broome, Cairns, Dili, Elcho Island, Gove, Groote Eylandt, Katherine, Kununurra, Maningrida, McArthur River Mine, Milingimbi, Tennant Creek, The Granites, Townsville), Alliance Airlines (Dili), Fly Tiwi (Gapuwiyak, Milikapiti, Minjilang, Nguiu, Pirlangimpi, Ramingining, Tennant Creek, Warruwi), Jetstar (Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Denpasar, Melbourne, Singapore, Sydney), Qantas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), QantasLink (Adelaide, Alice Springs, Broome, Cairns, Canberra, Dili, Townsville), Singapore Airlines (Singapore), Virgin Australia (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), and Virgin Australia Regional Airlines (Perth).  The scenery features a detailed rendition of the airport, with custom photoreal terrain, custom jetways, realistic ground markings, and custom ground clutter.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.48, requiring at least 721.77 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TaiModels has recently released their rendition of Hong Kong International (VHHH) for X-Plane 11 and 12, the 8th busiest airport in the World with a yearly average of 71 million passengers.  Hong Kong International was built to replace the old Â Kai Tak Airport, deemed too small to handle the amount of traffic it was dealing with and the insane amount of complaints from airlines because of all the delays that were a direct consequence of the fact it just could not scale up to the demand. Planning studies started in 1974, with construction work only kicking in almost 20 years later, in 1991. Completion was achieved in early 1998.  Built on a large artificial island, the total area of the airport (12.48 square kilometers) corresponds to nearly 1% of Hong Kongâs total area.Â   The airport is a hub for Cathay Pacific, Greater Bay Express, HK Express, and Hong Kong Airlines and is visited by over 100 other airlines with more than 180 destinations. Itâs also the Worldâs busiest cargo airport, hosting Air Hong Kong, Cathay Cargo, DHL Aviation, Hong Kong Airlines Cargo, Kalitta Air, Polar Air Cargo, and UPS Airlines.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of Hong Kong International Airport, with high-quality textures, complete autogen around the city, ground traffic plugins, weather textures for X-Plane 12, high-detail models inside the terminal, PBR materials, performance-friendly optimization, and compatibility with X-Plane 11 and 12.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $28.54, requiring at least 4.03 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Rfscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Federico Fellini International Airport (LIPR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Rimini in San Marino.Â   Its history dates back to the early 1930s when the first airfield was built in Rimini. Initially, the airfield was used primarily for military purposes during World War II. After the war, it was converted into a civilian airport.  Over the next few decades, Rimini-Miramare Airport underwent several renovations and expansions, including the construction of a new passenger terminal in the 1960s. However, as air traffic to the region continued to grow, it became clear that the airport needed to be further upgraded to meet the needs of modern aviation.  In the late 1990s, plans were made to upgrade the airport and expand its facilities. The new airport was designed by the architect Marco Bacchini, and the construction work began in 2004. The project included the construction of a new passenger terminal, a new control tower, a new runway, and other facilities.  The new airport was officially opened on June 15, 2011, and was named Federico Fellini International Airport in honor of the famous film director born in Rimini.Â   Itâs served on a seasonal basis by Albawings, Iran Air, Luxair, Neos, Ryanair, and WizzAir (the only one to offer a flight all year long to Tirana). The passenger figures sit at 900,000 a year.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom airport buildings, landside buildings, custom clutter, custom night lighting, and realistic ground markings.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.57, requiring at least 251.81 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. ColombiaVFR has recently released CapurganÃ¡ Airport (SKCA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the coastal town of CapurganÃ¡ in Colombia.Â   The city isn't accessible via roads, meaning only airplanes and boats can get there, making the airport an important - and fast - link to the rest of the country.  The airport is operated by the Colombian Civil Aviation Authority and has a small terminal building that provides basic facilities such as check-in counters, waiting areas, and restrooms.  CapurganÃ¡ Airport is known for its scenic location, surrounded by lush tropical forests and crystal-clear waters. The airport is near some of Colombia's most beautiful beaches, including Playa Blanca and El Aguacate. As a result, the airport is a popular destination for tourists who wish to explore the region's natural beauty and enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, snorkeling, and fishing.  Despite its popularity, CapurganÃ¡ Airport has limited flight options, with only a few airlines operating regular flights to and from the airport. The airport is also known for its challenging approach, as the runway is on a narrow strip of land between the sea and the mountains, making landing and takeoff difficult in certain weather conditions.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-detailed custom models, custom clutter, and lots of minor details such as graffiti art (as per real life), an abandoned airplane, and more.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.46, requiring at least 1.61 GB of free hard disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently shared further information on the development of their Airbus A330 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, including a batch of new images, the entrance into a closed beta stage, and more!  Mathijs Kok, Aerosoft's Product Manager, fed theirÂ A330 Preview ThreadÂ with a fresh batch of external imagery of their upcoming widebody, along with the information their beta testers can now send exterior shots of the aircraft. He then described the product's current stage regarding models, textures, animations, flight modeling, FADEC, manuals, autopilot, systems, etc. Description of which follows down below, verbatim: â Modeling, texturing, and almost all animations are solid. No worries about that.Â  In fact, Stefan and Anne are already working on the next bus.Â  Flight modeling, Engine modeling, and FADEC were massive issues, but we are 99% sure we can get within 3% of correct behavior. Any pilot will tell you that is fine as one airframe differs from another. Having two engines on one aircraft that differ by 3% is fine. Don't be mistaken, 3% is pretty much state-of-the-art.Â  Manuals and E-manual are more or less okay. The PDF manuals will be fine and available on release, the E-manual which is one of the highlights of the project as we want to get even beginners to be able to fly the A330 will be available but will need to be updated with the latest changes in code. Autopilot still needs work but is basically not very complex. It flies the route, does a cool ILS intercept, and lands fine. Systems are more or less okay. This is one area where you can spend another 20 years because where the real aircraft just has to display what is happening, we need to model why it happens. So when a computer decides the cabin needs to be heated a bit, a system will divert heat from an engine to a heat exchanger and feed the warmed air to the cabin. That means the engine will be affected, the electrical system will be involved and that means the generators will need to provide a bit more power. And that drops the thrust of the engine. See the complexity? We have a whopping lot of that code running because of some professional spin-offs of the bus projects. It's there and somewhere in Germany, a developer is crying because no customer will ever see it.Â  EFB, we are very proud of the EFB.Â  and while we need some tweaks, all is well. Navigraph, NavDataPro, weather, runway data, simbrief integration, are all working. I just love to be able to update the weather data automatically before planning an arrival, The fact we incorporated our own sat imagery so you can be sure you are doing your taxi route okay.. cool. MCDU, LNAV, VNAV... That is where we have most work open. Logically as it is by far the most complex part of the aircraft. LNAV seems to work, VNAV not so much but we know what we need to do.Â  ECAMS, loads of tweaks in fonts, placement, and things like that open (we had some bad luck in that part) but it is not code that affects flight.Â  Still one of my main worries now. Marketplace. This is the work you need to do to get something on the Marketplace. Not only contracts but a whopping lot of things you have to add. Not complex but I still need a few days on that for sure. Installer/Protection. With our own Aerosoft One system that is tried and tested (our DRM has not been hacked and has next to makes life for the customer easier (no need to enter any serial!s)) we are not worried about that at all.Â  Support, they are fully included in the testing so they should know what they need. Marketing. This department will be getting all information from me very soon.Â  They will invite streamers to have a look at the product before release and get the word out to websites and magazines. Sales still have to make sure that all our associate sale channels get all the marketing data and on release the files.  BaxterChico, one of their testers, has also shared some screenshots:  There's still no information regarding pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed as things progress! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Northern Sky Studio has recently released their rendition of Wrangell Airport (PAWG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Wrangell in Alaska with a yearly average of 15,000 passengers.  In 1920, a landing field was established in Wrangell, used primarily by floatplanes. Over the next few years, improvements were made to the landing field, including installing a beacon in 1925 and constructing a small hangar in 1928.  During World War II, the U.S. Army constructed a more substantial airfield at the site, which was used to support military operations in the Aleutian Islands. After the war, the airfield was turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), becoming a public airport.  In the 1950s and 1960s, the airport underwent significant upgrades, including extending the runway to its current length of 5,999 feet and constructing a new terminal building. These improvements helped to increase the airport's capacity and improve its safety.  In 1985, the airport received a major renovation, which included the construction of a new control tower and the installation of new navigation and communication equipment.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Dark Space has recently released the long-awaited version 1.20 of xEnviro, making it fully compatible with X-Plane 12, bringing realistic weather simulation to the newly released flight simulation platform.Â  â xEnviro 1.20 is an adaptation of 1.18 for the new platform, with a similar feature set and improved performance: no more than 10% of the framerate is compromised once the weather engine is running (using the recommended settings), making it more performant than 1.18 was. The full changelog follows down below: â ### Added - New architecture to accomodate procedural changes. â ### Changed - Sound processor temporary disabled. - Visual effects temporary disabled. - Cloud shader revision. - Shaders moved to HDR rendering. - More accurate light phase with glory and fogbow. - Default X-Plane precipitation temporary enabled. - Aerodrome surface set using X-Plane runway condition. - UI colors changed to match X-Plane palette. â ### Removed - Sounds settings. - Realistic aerial perspective. - Realistic night perspective. - Control water waves. - Draw wet aerodrome surface. - Draw drifting snow. - Draw snow in mountains. - Seasonal changes. - Windshield effects. - Volumetric aircraft lights effect. - Lens flares. - Diffraction spikes. - Glorious sun. - Custom rain. - Custom snow. - City lights. â The developer highlights that certain features were now temporarily removed and currently relying on native X-Plane functionalities, such as the xE sounds, waves, and seasonal changes. It is also stated that they will try to re-implement the features they have removed (refer to #removed in the changelog above). â Featuring industry-standard sky modeling, physics-based cloud visualization, and weather and time-dependent changes in atmospheric lighting, xEnviro aims to bring truly volumetric clouds to the world of X-Plane 12. â xE 1.20 is a free upgrade for previous owners of the X-Plane 11 version. They state it will remain a free upgrade for the foreseeable future: âAll updates within 2023 and likely 2024 will be free. A transition to 2.0 version would necessitate a substantial upgrade from the current capabilities of version 1.18â, stated the developer. â Itâs available on Threshold Store for $69.69, requiring at least a GTX 1050Ti or equivalent for the bare minimum and an RTX 2070 or equivalent for optimal performance.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
