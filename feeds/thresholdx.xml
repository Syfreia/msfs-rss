    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Ontario International Airport (KONT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of San Bernardino, Riverside, and Greater Los Angeles with a yearly average of 5 million passengers.  The airport was built in 1941 as an Army Air Corps aircraft training and operation base. After the war, it became a large storage, sale, and scrapping center for Army Air Forces aircraft.Â   Shortly after, in 1946, the airport was renamed from âOntario Municipal Airportâ to âOntario International Airportâ because of outgoing trans-pacific cargo flights. The first international passenger flight happened that same year, a Pacific Overseas Airlines flight from Shanghai to Ontario, inaugurating round-trip air passenger service between the United States and the Orient. Western Airlines began operating at the airport three years later, followed by Bonanza Air Lines in 1955.  A new terminal was opened in 1998, discontinuing the old terminals, which now function as the administration and the USO. There are 26 gates total, with 12 on T2 and 14 on T4. Terminal 2 hosts Alaska Airlines, Avianca El Salvador, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines, and Volaris. Terminal 4 hosts American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest.  Itâs a FedEx and UPS Airlines cargo hub, transporting cargo all over North America and Asia (UPS). Amazon Air, Ameriflight, Amerijet International, Asia Pacific Airlines, and Kalitta Air also serve it. Ontario International is the ninth-largest cargo airport in the United States.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom taxi signs, parallax, LOD optimization, realistic night lighting, custom jetways with gate numbers, and more.  Itâs available onÂ Verticalsimâs Shop for $19.99, requiring at least 2.16 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to Soarandskor for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MXI Design has recently released their rendition of Deauville-Normandie Airport (LFRG) Â for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the commune of Deauville in France with a yearly average of 160,000 passengers.  Inaugurated in 1931 by the initiative of EugÃ¨ne Collas (the mayor of Deauville back then), it initially served as a business airport, eventually opening up for tourist charter flights as time went by.  For a short while, it used to be considered a third airport for Paris, but the distance (two-hour drive) and the lack of transportation options made it unfeasible, and they quickly ruled it out.  In 1952, they built a cement runway, allowing it to handle more aircraft types. Seven years later, a control tower was built, along with a runway extension to 1,600 meters in 1961.  In 1971, a passenger terminal was inaugurated, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and making it more suitable for commercial flights.Â   Recently, the operator has decided to build a new terminal, scheduled to reach completion in late 2023, expanding its area from 1,750 to 3,800 square meters. The state will cover 95% of the total cost; the remainder will come from Deauville. They also intend to add a photovoltaic park nearby to reach completion between 2024-2027. â It's served on a seasonal basis by Aegean Airlines and Volotea. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detailed PBR models of the terminals and their respective interiors (built with performance in mind), custom taxiway signs, 3D passengers, custom ground textures, and custom night lighting.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.77, requiring at least 543.61 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BEAUTIFUL MODEL of the World and AmSim teamed up again to build a rendition of Daytona Beach International Airport (KDAB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, known for headquartering the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.  Daytona Beach was built in the 1930s on a 299-ha piece of land featuring two grass runways. Passenger service started in the same decade with Eastern Air Lines, followed by National Airlines a year later.Â   A little before World War 2, the airport got four paved runways, allowing for the operation of DC-2s and DC-3s. WW2 had the airport taken over by the US Navy, becoming the Naval Air Station Daytona Beach, followed by an extensive military construction effort. Many of the buildings were utilized by Embry-Riddle University after their move from Miami two decades later.  In 1992, a large terminal was built, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and transforming the old terminal into an international passenger terminal, followed by a final runway extension that sticks to this day.Â   As of mid-late 2021, the airport had 364,071 aircraft operations, with 62% corresponding to general aviation. The passenger figures sit at an average of 800,000 per year.Â   Itâs served by American Airlines (Charlotte), American Eagle (Charlotte), Avelo Airlines (to begin in June 2023), and Delta Air Lines (Atlanta).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings, high-resolution ground textures, landside buildings, a detailed terminal interior, and compatibility with FSLTL traffic.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $18.26, requiring at least 2.75 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to mtn_dude_ for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently announced their next project for X-Plane 11 and 12: a rendition of Faro International Airport (LPFR), serving the city of Faro in Algarve, Portugal, with a yearly average of 8 million passengers. It was inaugurated in 1965 by then president AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s, with a government-owned DC-3 being the first airplane ever to touch its runway, followed by TAP Air Portugalâs Lockheed Super Constellation, transporting government officials and important guests. Scheduled passenger service started two days after, connecting Faro to Lisbon. In that same year, the airport recorded 58,000 passengers. Faro has only seen two significant developments in its first 40 years: a new passenger terminal building in 1989, and its eventual enlargement in 2001, to cope with the increased demands for air travel. The 2010s brought even more pressure for expansion, which reached completion in 2013 after a two-phase work, increasing its passenger handling capacity from six million to eight million passengers. Minor expansion work went on over the remainder of the decade, with the airport now able to handle up to 9 million passengers a year, with 22 stands and 36 boarding gates.  Itâs a base for EasyJet and Ryanair, flying to many European destinations. The visitorsâ list includes many traditional European airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Scandinavian, and TAP Air Portugal and popular low-cost carriers such as Condor, Eurowings, Jet2, Smartwings, and Wizz Air. Thereâs no release date or pricing information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RDPresets has recently teased their upcoming rendition of Faro International Airport (LPFR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Faro in Algarve, Portugal, with a yearly average of 8 million passengers. In 1965, Faro Airport was officially inaugurated by then-president AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s. The historic moment was marked by the landing of a government-owned DC-3 aircraft, followed by TAP Air Portugal's Lockheed Super Constellation, which transported government officials and esteemed guests. Two days later, scheduled passenger service commenced, connecting Faro to Lisbon, and the airport welcomed approximately 58,000 passengers in its first year. During its initial four decades of operation, Faro Airport experienced two notable developments: a new passenger terminal in 1989 and its first expansion in 2001. However, it was during the 2010s that the pressure for growth became even more significant, leading to a comprehensive expansion project that reached completion in 2013 through a two-phase approach. The project increased the airport's passenger capacity from six million to eight million. Additional minor expansion work took place throughout the decade, resulting in the current capability of handling up to 9 million passengers annually. The airport boasts 22 stands and 36 boarding gates. Faro Airport is a base for popular airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair, offering flights to numerous European destinations. The airport's list of visitors includes traditional European carriers such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, and TAP Air Portugal. It also caters to well-known low-cost carriers like Condor, Eurowings, Jet2, Smartwings, and Wizz Air. The scenery is set to release tomorrow, and the pricing has yet to be discovered. Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ESSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the province of Uppland in Sweden with a yearly average of 26 million passengers. Itâs the busiest airport in the country and the third busiest in Scandinavia.  Opened in 1962, it quickly replaced Stockholm Bromma as the countryâs main international airport due to its longer runway, allowing SAS to utilize the DC-8 for flights to North America. It was mainly an international airport during its first decades, with most domestic flights operating out of Bromma.Â   In 1983, Linjeflyg, a former domestic airline, moved from Bromma to Arlanda, operating their domestic routes on Terminal 4. A few years later, the airport got two new terminals exclusively for domestic use.Â   The airport currently features four terminals, three in use as of 2022, with no separation between domestic and international flights.Â   Itâs a hub for Scandinavian Airlines and Eurowings Europe and a focus city for Finnair, Novair, and Ryanair. London is the most popular European destination, with nearly 2 million passengers shared between Heathrow and Gatwick, followed by Copenhagen with 1,394,000.Â   The scenery, developed by one of their independent developers, Marcus Nyberg, features animated jetways, functional and correct VDGS, enhanced interiors for all terminals, high-quality custom GSE, animated vehicles, weather-influenced snowbanks, a high-resolution mesh, and a custom GSX profile.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $24.01, requiring at least 6.35 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
