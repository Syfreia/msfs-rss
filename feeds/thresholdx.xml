    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Rafael NÃºÃ±ez International Airport (SKCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Cartagena, Colombia, with a yearly average of 7.2 million passengers.  It was built in 1946 as Crespo Air Field, with TACA Colombia being the first airline to serve the city, albeit very briefly, as they went under a year later, with LANSA taking the remaining slots.  By 1979, the airport averaged around 99 flights a week, which was not enough in terms of touristic volume for the local hotels, leading to pressure for an airport redevelopment in 1982: a new passenger terminal and a runway extension, allowing for bigger aircraft. It is now the fourth busiest airport in the country.  Itâs a hub for Avianca and served by Air Century, American Airlines, Arajet, Avianca Costa Rica, Clic, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Edelweiss Air, JetBlue, KLM, Latam Colombia, Latam Peru, Spirit, Wingo.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, high-detail buildings, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Kiss Simulation has recently released their rendition of Sarajevo International Airport (LQSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers.  It was built in 1966 and opened for traffic three years later, although domestically. International operations only started a year later, with Frankfurt being its first international destination.Â   The first renovation happened nearly 20 years later for the 1984 Winter Olympics, with a new terminal building, a runway extension, and navigational system improvements.  The terminal was expanded in 2017, with a new 10,000-square-meter building able to handle up to 2 million passengers a year.  Its mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather have led to multiple financial losses over the years, with the most memorable one dating back to December 2015, when over 40% of the flights were canceled. The only way they could fix it would be by moving the threshold an additional 200 meters, which would shorten the runway, which is not ideal given that itâs already relatively short at 2,600 meters.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with the new terminal extension, custom runway profile, real-world ILS profile, custom-made ground textures, up-to-date ground layout, runway weathering, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.18, requiring at least 792.15 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has shared more previews of their upcoming BrasÃ­lia - President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR), the third busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. The airport was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. A proper terminal building was inaugurated in 1971, designed by TÃ©rcio Fontana Pacheco, a Brazilian Air Force architect. The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more, divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. The upcoming scenery is said to feature animated moving walkways, an up-to-date ground layout, terminal interiors, custom jetways, detailed landside, and more.  Thereâs no release date yet, but itâs said to be âalmost there.âStay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

The airport dates back to 1898, when the Signal Corps of the US Army was stationed there, building what would become Olmsted Field and having its first planes landing in 1918.  It was used almost exclusively for military purposes up until 1969 when the Middletown Air Depot closed, and airline flights moved from the nearby Capital City Airport to Olmstead State Airport, renamed Harrisburg International Airport in 1973, which was also when the passenger terminal reached full completion, designed by architect William Pereira.  Thirty-one years after the passenger terminalâs inauguration, a new 360,000 square-foot terminal was built, costing around $120 million and designed by the Sheward Partnership.  Allegiant, American, American Eagle, Delta, Delta Connection, Frontier, United, and United Express serve it, connecting the city to their most prominent hubs.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed buildings, high-resolution ground textures, PBR, realistic wear &amp; tear, custom mesh, custom night lighting, and custom jetways.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $15.28, requiring at least 2.24 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Ontario International Airport (KONT) for X-Plane 12, serving the cities of San Bernardino, Riverside, and Greater Los Angeles with a yearly average of 5 million passengers.  The airport was built in 1941 as an Army Air Corps aircraft training and operation base. After the war, it became a large storage, sale, and scrapping center for Army Air Forces aircraft.Â   Shortly after, in 1946, the airport was renamed from âOntario Municipal Airportâ to âOntario International Airportâ because of outgoing trans-Pacific cargo flights. The first international passenger flight happened that same year, a Pacific Overseas Airlines flight from Shanghai to Ontario, inaugurating round-trip air passenger service between the United States and the Orient. Western Airlines began operating at the airport three years later, followed by Bonanza Air Lines in 1955.  A new terminal was opened in 1998, discontinuing the old terminals, which now function as the administration and the USO. There are 26 gates total, with 12 on T2 and 14 on T4. Terminal 2 hosts Alaska Airlines, Avianca El Salvador, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines, and Volaris. Terminal 4 hosts American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest.  Itâs a FedEx and UPS Airlines cargo hub, transporting cargo all over North America and Asia (UPS). Amazon Air, Ameriflight, Amerijet International, Asia Pacific Airlines, and Kalitta Air also serve it. Ontario International is the ninth-largest cargo airport in the United States.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with brand-new XP12 weather maps, accurate cargo ramps, an up-to-date ground layout, HDR lighting, PBR texturing, SAM jetways, LOD optimization, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.50, requiring at least 1.61 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>
