    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Tivat Airport (LYTV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in Montenegro with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers (pre-pandemic).Â   The airport was originally just a grass airfield in 1957, with a small apron and a terminal building. Most traffic was strictly domestic for the first decade, with DC-3s and II-14s. The first modernization began between 1968 and 1971, with an asphalt runway, a bigger apron, extended taxiways, and a substantial terminal expansion. An earthquake eight years later forced them to refurbish it again, with increased dimensions to fit widebody aircraft. After an ownership change in 2003, the airport had another major modernization, with an improved terminal.Â   In the early 2010s, the administration realized the current terminal would not hold up with the gradual increase in the yearly average, so planning and building a second terminal, inaugurated in 2018 by their Prime Minister.Â   Most of the traffic is seasonal, peaking in the summer. Many airlines from all over Europe are visiting, including Austrian Airlines, easyJet, Edelweiss, Eurowings, LOT, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Transavia, and Turkish. Air Montenegro and Air Serbia are the only ones offering all-year-long coverage with a route to Belgrade. Â   Developed by one of their indies (Rasha Tucakov), the scenery features a high-detail rendition of Tivat Airport, with detailed terminal interiors, parallax windows, custom apron and runway textures, custom library objects, and many custom points of interest on approach.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.44, requiring at least 1.83 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MM Simulations has recently teased the progress on their rendition of LiÃ¨ge Airport (EBLG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 5th biggest cargo airport in Europe and 22nd in the World.Â   Originally a military airfield, it was used by the Germans during World War II as a base for their Luftwaffe aircraft. After the war, the Belgian Air Force used the airport until the 1960s, when it was converted into a commercial airport. In the 1980s, LiÃ¨ge Airport became known for its cargo operations and became a major European freight transport hub. Today, the airport is one of the largest cargo airports in the World, handling over 900,000 tons of goods each year and serving as a vital link in the global supply chain.  TUI fly Belgium is the only airline offering scheduled flights to and from LiÃ¨ge, with routes to Alicante, Gran Canaria, MÃ¡laga, and Tenerife-South. The traffic figures sit at less than 400,000 passengers yearly.  The developers have been showcasing the scenery on theirÂ Facebook page, with many screenshots of the terminal interior, cargo area, and some of the cargo apron. A selection of these screenshots will be posted alongside this article.  Thereâs still no pricing and release date information, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. DarkBlueScenery has recently released their rendition of Lanzhou-Zhongchuan International Airport (ZLLL) for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12, serving Lanzhou in China with a yearly average of 7 million passengers.Â   Inaugurated in 1970, Lanzhou Airport is the Chinese airport furthest from the center of the city it serves, at an incredible 71 kilometers away from downtown. Such distance is explained by the areaâs geography, which doesnât offer many options.Â   The first expansion project started in 1997, increasing the airportâs passenger handling capabilities to nearly 5 million a year. It held up well until the early 2010s when the operator finally saw the need to expand it again with a brand-new terminal. Terminal 2âs construction began that same year, opening five years later.  With traffic projections nearing the 10 million passenger ballpark shortly, they have decided to expand again with a brand new terminal currently under construction. The work started in 2019, costing 31.69 billion Yuan and a total area three times bigger than both current terminals combined. For such an ambitious goal, they had to demolish an entire town and adjacent villages, totaling up to 10.7 square kilometers of area.  The airport is served by many domestic airlines, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Spring Airlines, and Tianjin Airlines.Â   The scenery depicts the current stage of the airport, with Terminal 3 still under construction, featuring custom ground textures, custom models for Terminals 1 and 2, a cargo terminal, custom jetways, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.18, requiring at least 384.43 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSX3D has recently released their rendition of Sisteron-Vaumeilh Aerodrome (LFNS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a restricted access public airfield on a large plateau between the Durance River and the Southern French Alps.Â   Built in 1938 as a military airfield by the French Air Force but soon taken over by the Germans during World War II, it was heavily damaged but later rebuilt and used by the French Air Force until 1965. In the decades that followed, the airfield was used for a variety of purposes, including glider training and airshows. Today, it is a popular destination for recreational pilots and aviation enthusiasts and is known for its stunning views of the surrounding countryside and the nearby Alps. Its rich history and scenic location make it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in aviation or military history.  The aerodrome is famous among glider pilots for its infrastructure, weather, geography, and relevance to the glider culture, with over 50 years of history. It has ranked number one among soaring dedicated airfields in France by the French FÃ©dÃ©ration de Vol Ã  Voile.  The lack of general aviation traffic (more so, itâs highly restricted) makes it perfect for glider pilots looking for a good time.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airfield, with high-quality 3D models, PBR texturing, custom ground textures and taxiways, custom clutter, and realistic hangars.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.90, requiring at least 340.36 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of John F. Kennedy International Airport (KJFK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in New York City with a yearly average of 60 million passengers. Built on top of an old golf course 74 years ago, the then-called Idlewild Airport had a single 7,365 square meter terminal and six runways. The current name only came to be in late 1963, after John F. Kennedyâs assassination. It also marked the important leap to the busiest airport in the region, beating LaGuardia and reaching a respectable second place overall in the United States. The busiest international gateway to the United States is served and visited by over 90 airlines, covering all the inhabited continents around the globe. JetBlue tops the market share chart, with 28.8% or 15,624,961 passengers, followed by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, with 28.4% (15,390,437) and 14.5% (7,870,971), respectively. From foreign operators, Air France leads the way with 1.9% of the total market share or 1,025,339 passengers. The scenery features hand-made ground textures, a true-to-life airport landside recreation, accurately modeled and positioned lighting, high-detail models of all airport buildings and objects (and surroundings), accurate taxi signage, an updated layout, custom-built jetways with variations as per real life, a fully animated JFK AirTrain between each terminal, a precise representation of the famous Canarsie Approach, LOD optimization for every model, custom static aircraft (optional), and full compatibility with the iniManager scenery configurator. It also includes a replica of the TWA Hotel with an intricately detailed interior and the Constellation aircraft in TWA colors.  Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $25.04, requiring at least 4.25 GB of free hard disk space to install. The developers recommend uninstalling Asoboâs hand-crafted KJFK to avoid performance issues.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Long Island MacArthur Airport (KISP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the population of Long Island in southeastern New York State with a yearly average of 1.6 million passengers.  Built in 1942 with financial help from the Civil Aeronautics Administration (now FAA), which funded the construction of three paved runways, it was soon renamed MacArthur Airport after General Douglas MacArthur, famous for his dramatic escape from the Philippines. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation built the first hangar only two years later, and the first terminal came in 1949.Â   Commercial service began in 1960 with Allegheny Airlines, offering flights to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. A bigger passenger terminal was completed six years later, further expanding the airportâs passenger handling capabilities. By the end of the 1960s, Allegheny and Mohawk Airlines offered several flights a day. The 1970s brought American Airlines and Delta Air Lines onboard.  Expansion work started in 2004, with the construction of a brand new Southwest Terminal for $65 million, adding four new gates and space for restaurants and shops. Two years later, they built another four new gates. The expansion was made without state approval and violated fire and safety codes, causing a fair share of drama.Â   MacArthur Airport is currently served by three airlines: Breeze Airways (Charleston), Frontier Airlines (Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, and West Palm Beach), and Southwest Airlines (Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa, and West Palm Beach).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail models of the airport terminals, hangars, buildings, and other facilities, with terminal interiors, custom animated jetways, up-to-date taxiways and stands, custom lighting, and animated humans.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $21.00, requiring at least 1.57 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MM Simulations has recently released their rendition of LiÃ¨ge Airport (EBLG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, an important European cargo hub, ranking 5th in the continent and 22nd overall.  Like many other European airports, LiÃ¨ge started as a military airfield, becoming a commercial airport in the 1960s after decades of extensive use by the Belgian Air Force (and the Luftwaffe during WW2). It wasnât until the 1980s that it shifted its orientation toward cargo operations, eventually becoming one of the busiest in the World, with over 900,000 tons of cargo handled yearly.  Â Airline-wise, TUI fly Belgium is the sole scheduled flight operator with flights to Spain. The figures sit at 400,000 passengers yearly.  The scenery features an accurately modeled terminal and interior, with custom night lighting, custom parking positions matching real-life data, custom landside buildings, 3D people and animated objects, and PBR materials.  Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ andÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.29/$20.12 (respectively), requiring at least 5.62 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RWY26 Simulations has recently released their rendition of North Eleuthera Airport (MYEH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the islands of Harbour Island, Spanish Wells, and the northernmost third of the Bahamas. The airport was established in the 1950s as a small airstrip to support the local fishing industry. However, with increased tourism to the island, the airport was expanded in the 1960s to accommodate larger aircraft. In the 1970s, the airport underwent further renovations and upgrades, including the construction of a new terminal building and runway extension. Today, North Eleuthera Airport is a popular entry point for tourists visiting Eleuthera and nearby islands, with several airlines offering regular flights to and from the airport. Itâs served by American Eagle (Charlotte, Miami), Bahamasair (Governorâs Harbour, Nassau, Rock Sound), Delta Connection (Atlanta), Pineapple Air (Governorâs Harbour, Nassau), Silver Airways (Fort Lauderdale), and Southern Air Charter (Nassau). The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom models of the terminal and landside buildings, custom ground textures, custom ground clutter, static aircraft, and custom night lighting.  Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $11.05, requiring at least 45.81 MB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Heaven Designs has recently released their rendition of Brive-Souillac Airport (LFSL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the commune of Brive-la-Gaillarde in France with a yearly average of 90,000 passengers.  The airport was inaugurated in 2010 after a decade of planning and trouble with environmental organizations regarding a colony of the large blue butterfly. It wasnât until 2005 that situation was finally out of the way, and they could begin with the earthwork. The ICAO, LFSL, used to be assigned to the Toul-RosiÃ¨res Air Base, which closed in 2004.  At the grand cost of 48.7 million euros, raised by the local Syndicate and partially helped by the government, the airport sports a modern terminal able to handle national and international passengers, a VIP building for private aviation, and a car park able to take up to 250 cars. The main runway is paved and measures around 2,100 meters, enough for regional aircraft and 738s/A320s.Â   Itâs served by Air France and Amelia International with a flight to Paris-Orly, and Ryanair offers three destinations: Charleroi, London-Stansted, and Porto.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom 3D models, custom textures, functional flags, and improved default ground textures.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $7.19, requiring at least 146.31 MB of free hard disk space to install.
