    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FS Designs has recently released their rendition of Pensacola International Airport (KPNS) for X-Plane 12, the second-busiest airport in North Florida with a yearly average of 2.5 million passengers.  Pensacola got its first passenger terminal in 1935, with commercial service to begin two years later with Atlantic and Gulf Airlines, although very short-lived due to financial issues. National Airlines took over in 1938 with flights to Mobile and Jacksonville.  World War 2 saw the airport become a US Navy training facility, granting it a new control tower and runway.Â   The terminal was expanded 12 years ago at $35 million, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and modernizing the infrastructure. There are talks of a new concourse and parking expansion to come shortly.  American Airlines, American Express, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. Delta tops the market share chart with 26.04%, followed by Southwest and PSA Airlines with 21.63% and 10.87%, respectively.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution ortho imagery, high-quality 3D modeling, PBR texturing, custom 4K ground textures, performance-friendly optimization, up-to-date layout, and wear and tear effects using the latest technology.  Itâs available on theirÂ storeÂ for $14.99, requiring at least 1.74 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released their rendition of Philadelphia International Airport (KPHL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 21st busiest airport in the United States with a yearly average of 19.6 million passengers.  Philadelphia International started its life as a training airport back in 1925. For over 15 years, it didnât even have a terminal building built in 1940, so airlines finally abandoned Camden Central Airport for it.Â   World War 2 converted the airport into a First Air Force training airfield, organizing and training various fighter and air bomber groups throughout the war. It was returned to civil control in September 1945.Â   It was granted international status that same year and got a new terminal in 1953, with further expansion in the late 1950s. By 1957, it was served by Eastern, TWA, United, American, National, Capital, Allegheny, and Delta.  The terminals were modernized for the first time in 1970, and new terminals followed in the same decade (D in 1973, E in 1977), costing around $300 million.  Nowadays, itâs a hub for American Airlines, with 63.75% of the market share, offering a huge list of destinations, domestic and international. Frontier takes second place with 11.02%, focusing on the domestic market and Central America. Spirit, Delta, and Southwest follow with 6.59%, 6.00%, and 4.51%.  The scenery features a high-fidelity rendition of the airport, with optimized texturing, main terminal interiors modeled, custom GSE vehicles, landside buildings, compatibility with most AI plugins, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $18.46, requiring at least 2.03 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!   â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Marko Mamula, X-Craftsâ founder, has made an eight-minute video showcasing the progress on their FMS for the upcoming E-Jets Family release for X-Plane 11 and 12. Â  The video shows a step-by-step setup of two different routes, in America (Los Angeles to San Francisco) and Europe (Glasgow to London City), showing how the FMS handles altitude restrictions, etc.Â   The E-Jets Family by X-Crafts aims to bring highly detailed and accurate models of the interior and exterior of the entire lineup, with an authentic flight management system, autopilot modes, and realistic systems, helped by real E-Jet pilots and instructors.  The E-Jets are a series of regional jet airliners manufactured by Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace company. The E-Jets were introduced in 2004 with the E170 and E190 models and have since expanded to include the E175 and E195 models. They are designed for short- to medium-haul flights and can carry between 70 and 124 passengers, depending on the model. They are known for their efficiency, comfort, and versatility, making them a popular choice for regional airlines worldwide.  Thereâs still no information on a potential release date or pricing, but you can follow the developmentÂ here. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Aerosoft Previews A330 Sounds for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-04-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Mathijs Kok, Aerosoftâs Product Manager, has posted on their forum thread about the development progress on their upcoming Airbus A330 for Microsoft Flight Simulator with two videos showcasing the work-in-progress sounds for the airplane. They mention having listened to it on a high-end audio system (Edifier R1700BT speakers driven by a Topping DX3 DAC), recommending everyone to play it as loud as possible to experience the quality of the sound set. The first video showcases the sounds as is, internally and externally. The second video has the headphone simulation activated, trying to mimic the behavior of a real-life Bose A20 Aviation Headset and its noise-canceling capabilities. They claim 99% of the customers have never been inside a real flight deck, therefore lacking a frame of reference, but also reinstating itâs as close as what a pilot hears as it gets.  P. Astarto, presumably one of their beta testers, shared two screenshots of a community-made AirAsia livery on taxi and take-off: Thereâs still no pricing and release date information, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>
