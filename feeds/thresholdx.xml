    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Silvercrest Creations has recently released their rendition of Kumasi International Airport (DGSI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Kumasi in Ghana with a yearly average of 500,000 passengers.  The Royal Air Force built the airport in the early 1940s to serve as a military air base, becoming a civilian airport two years after the conflict was over upon authorization granted by the British Empire.Â  â A decade later, the airport underwent major redevelopment work on the runway and infrastructure, ensuring proper viability for commercial operations. The runway was improved again twenty years later with lights for nocturnal operations. â A new terminal was built in 1993 - commissioned by President Jerry John Rawlings -.Then, in 1999, it was changed from a military and commercial hybrid into a commercial airport only. â New terminal improvements came in 2008 for the African Cup of Nations and between 2014 and 2022, including a full expansion with the construction of a new 7,000 square meter terminal with VIP lounges, restaurants, commercial areas, three boarding gates, a central screening system, and an IATA compliant baggage handling system.Â  â The airport is currently served by Africa World Airlines and Passion Air, with flights to Accra and Wa. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a 3D model of the passenger terminal, custom objects, a terminal interior, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $9.87, requiring at least 432.56 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title> âA New Adventureâ: Industry Veteran Mathijs Kok Joins PMDG</title>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Yesterday morning, Mathijs Kok reappeared on the Aerosoft Forums under a new account - weeks after announcing his departure from the company after 20 years of service -defending his former company with a statement on how he shaped the forum as he'd enjoy it if he were a customer, and then signing the post as "Mathijs Kok - PMDG Simulations." â As PMDG had not officially announced such a move, the community wondered whether it was an elaborate prank rather than the next big transfer of the flight simulation niche. For a while, there were no answers from either Aerosoft or PMDG, but Robert Randazzo broke the silence, confirming that Mathijs had, in fact, joined PMDG: "I'm personally thrilled to welcome my very long-time friend, Mathijs, to the PMDG team. I'll have more to say on this topic a bit later - and I may or may not shine a light on some of what we'll have him doing as part of our expansion going forward". "Anticipate him hanging back a bit while he gains his footing and gets up-to-speed. Our culture is very different from the one he has left behind after two decades- and his role here will be quite a bit different as well. There are a few key moments in PMDG's history- and it has been 15 years since we made specific, positive changes to improve the wider skill level and capabilities of our team. Mathijs coming aboard the PMDG team is one of numerous changes taking place in the background that go a long way toward my strategic objectives for PMDG- and I assure you you will be excited when you see what that plan looks like.", he concluded. â â Mathijs himself had also made an appearance on PMDG's forum, thanking everyone for the support and explaining his decision to leave Aerosoft after so many years: "As a project manager, you have a task and resources, and they were not well aligned in my opinion. Aerosoft in 2023 is also a very different company than it was when I joined". "When he (Robert Randazzo) offered me to join his team, I did not hesitate. I did not even think about it. It feels like an adventure. One that is very welcome and really reinvigorated my love for the hobby and its users", he added. â â Then, he stated how PMDG's structure suits his style better, with no sales department or marketing office aiming exclusively at production and sales happening almost automatically in response to a great product. â Threshold will keep you informed on the matter may Robert Randazzo reveal his new position at PMDG.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly X Simulations has recently released their rendition of Teesside International Airport (EGNV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving North East England with a yearly average of 200,000 passengers.  It started as an RAF airfield in 1941, housing the RAF and the Royal Canadian Air Force during WW2.Â   Twenty years later, the airfield was developed into a civil airport named Tees-Side Airport. Many airlines served it during its first decade, including British Midland, BKS Air Transport, Dan-Air, Autair, and Channel Airways.Â   The 1970s were particularly rough for Teesside regarding scheduled services, with holiday flights becoming its primary source of passenger traffic through the wings of Northeast Airlines, Britannia Airways, Aviaco, Spantax, and Aviogenex. Â  Privatization came in 1987, with local authorities retaining their shares and the airport getting its current name: Teesside International Airport.  The airport was heavily upgraded in 2017 after a troublesome decade post-2008 crisis leading to a massive drop in passenger traffic figures leading to many airlines abandoning it for other nearby airports.Â   The renewal and subsequent takeover in 2018 brought back a lot of traffic, and the figures have been rising ever since.  BH Air, Eastern Airways, KLM, Loganair, Ryanair, and TUI Airways currently serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR texturing, custom orthophoto for the airport and surroundings, custom terminal interior, custom ground textures, high-resolution textures, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $15.25, requiring at least 2.76 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

The complete changelog follows down below:   Robert Randazzo has also informed us about a delay on the 737-700 and -800's 3.00.0070 update on Marketplace (a version behind), which should match the other members of the lineup on 3.00.0071.Â   The EFB is still undergoing testing, with them recently pushing a build to their beta team with changes based on their feedback. They are already discussing a potential release date.  The 737 Lineup is available onÂ PMDG's StoreÂ for $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800), $49.99 (737-900), and $34.99 (737-600).

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. German flight sim developer Aerosoft is planning to develop an Airbus A321neo alongside the previously announced A330neo for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â  â According to a post on the website of the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Aerosoft has received â¬459,000 from a grant to partially fund their development of the âAirbusNEO seriesâ, which includes the A330neo and A321neo.Â  â â The grant was set up by the German government in 2019 to help boost the games sector within Germany, and to make Germany a hub for game development in Europe. The German government has provided up to â¬50 million each year in grants, and has funded over 400 different video game projects. â Currently, Aerosoft has been hard at work on their highly anticipated A330ceo project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which has come under new management after their previous product manager of more than twenty years, Mathijs Kok, left Aerosoft for the PMDG team. As of the time of writing, Kokâs new position at PMDG has not been revealed to the public yet.As for the A321neo and A330neo, there are a lot of unknowns about their respective projects. The posting on the website says that, âNumerous functions, animations and sound effects are to be developed using state-of-the-art tools that have not yet been implemented in Microsoft Flight Simulatorâ, suggesting that the complexity of these two aircraft will be something unlike their previous work in MSFS. We do not know when an intended release date would be, which aircraft will be released first, or if Aerosoft plans on releasing them as a bundle, as suggested by the post.Â  â At this point in time, much about both aircraft are up to speculation, but what we do know for certain is that they are planned, and they are coming in the near future.Threshold will keep you updated on all the developments regarding the upcoming Aerosoft airliners, so stay tuned! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Matt Wagner was recently Interviewed on 'The Mover and Gonky Show'. This was a two hour long video which included a DCS World Q&amp;A. There are some interesting points made in the video so IÂ encourage you to watch the video aswell.  A Broader Scope:The grand vision is to have a battlefield where ground units can operate seamlessly alongside helicopters and jets. This would mean an immersive experience where users could transition between different theaters of war, each detailed and realistic. â Ground Movement Animation:One of the focal areas for the Eagle Dynamics team currently is the ground movement for infantry. The older animations have stood the test of time but are now due for a refresh. An updated animation is in the works, promising more fluid and realistic movements, in sync with the advancements in game development technology. â New Additions and Updates:While some might be disappointed about the absence of Ukraine and Taiwan maps due to their sensitive nature, the future holds promise: Media Influence:The recent release of Top Gun 2 has spurred an interest in DCS modules. The movie's success resulted in a surge of sales for DCS modules, prompting Eagle Dynamics to release the special 'Be a Maverick' pack, which bundled the F-14, F/A-18, and Supercarrier. â Challenges and Solutions:It's not just about adding new content, but also about refining existing modules: â Potential Future Additions:Questions have arisen regarding the addition of certain aircraft like the SAAB Gripen or the Rafael. The challenge in adding 4+ gen aircraft is the acquisition of necessary resources. However, with partnerships and introductions, nothing is off the table. There's even been talk about the Flanker being introduced as a full-fidelity DCS module, though data acquisition remains a significant hurdle. â</summary>
