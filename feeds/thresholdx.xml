    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of London Stansted Airport (EGSS) scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in the UK after Heathrow, Gatwick, and Manchester, with a yearly average of 23 million passengers.  Stansted was originally a bomber airfield and maintenance depot for WW2, inaugurated in 1943 by the Royal Air Force and shared between them and the USAF.  Twenty years after the war, Stansted was embraced by holiday charter operators looking for a cheaper alternative to Gatwick and Heathrow. It resulted in fast growth, leading to a new development plan in the mid-80s to expand the airportâs capacity to 15 million passengers a year.  Construction work started in the late 80s at the cost of roughly 100 million pounds, adding a railway branch to the airport. It won the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 1990.  A new expansion program followed between 2007 and 2009, adding 5,900 square meters of terminal area. A few years later, in 2013, the terminal underwent a redevelopment plan to modernize the airport further.  The airport is a Ryanair, Jet2.com, and TUI hub, flying people across Europe and North Africa. Itâs mostly a low-cost carrier airport, with the eventual seasonal presence of British Airways and Lufthansa.  Stansted is also widely used for cargo, visited by Asiana Cargo, Cargolux, China Cargo Airlines, China Southern Cargo, FedEx Express, Qatar Airways Cargo, Turkish Cargo, UPS Airlines, and Turkmenistan Airlines.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, high-detail terminal buildings, and their respective interiors, a custom GSX profile, custom jetways, LOD optimization on every model, custom static aircraft, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $17.57, requiring at least 5.86 GB of free hard disk to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Microsoft and Aeroplane Heaven Release Boeing 307 Stratoliner for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Microsoft Flight Simulator team partnered with Aeroplane Heaven to develop the 10th airplane of their âLocal Legendâ series: the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, the first airliner in revenue service with a pressurized cabin. Its roots date back to 1935, when five of the biggest North American carriers had signed a contract with Douglas to fund the development of the DC-4, with a contribution of $100,000 each and an agreement not to fly other aircraft that were within its expected weight figures. The project was a disaster, leading to the airlines canceling their orders, yet still wishing to buy a large four-engine airplane at one point. Later that same year, Boeing designed a four-engine aircraft based on the B-17, with a larger pressurized part of the fuselage and the same wings, tail, rudder, undercarriage, and engines. Over the following months, the engineers extensively tested the pressurization by coating the fuselage with soapy water and then watching for bubbles indicating an air leak.  Three years later, the prototype was ready to roll, flying for the first time in late 1938 and eventually crashing in early 1939 after a nearly irrecoverable stall that tore off the left outer wing with the engine still attached. The ten occupants were killed that day. After figuring out what caused the accident and coming up with a solution, the program was finally back on track, with the approval to operate commercially in March 1940 and Pan Am being the first customer.  The Stratoliner could cruise at speeds of 350 km/h at 20,000ft, with a crew of six and either 33, 38, or 60 passengers, with a range of 3,846 km. Itâs available on the MSFS Marketplace for $14.99. â</summary>

    <title>Simworks Studios Announces TBM series and Kodiak 900 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimWorks Studios took to their Discord server to unveil the first renditions of their Kodiak 900 and to announce the TBM series for Microsoft Flight Simulator ! â The exterior model for the Kodiak 900 is fully completed and ready to get in the simulator for testing. The 900 model, sharing a lot of features with the previously released 100 model, allows for a swift and efficient setup and testing process, thanks to its practically identical foundation regarding their codebase. This compatibility drastically reduces the initial work needed to get an aircraft up to scratch, leaving more room for refinement and enhancements for their newest addition.Â  The strength of the Kodiak 100âs codebase spares developers from the need to start from scratch, thus significantly streamlining the development process for the Kodiak 900. The Kodiak 900 will have an improved 3D model, not only in visual appearance but also in terms of performance. â And the exciting news doesnât stop there ! SimWorks Studios is thrilled to announce the TBM series for MSFS. Following a licensing agreement with Daher back in January, they had gained the rights to recreate the TBM 850, 910 and 960 models. Although the launch is quite a distance away, work on these aircraft will commence in August.Â  â The upside of this is that the majority of the required avionics will be mostly ready by then. The TBM850âs EFIS40 is notably akin to the PC-12âs, significantly simplifying its integration. Plus the maturity of the G1000 and G3000, along with their new plugin system support, will facilitate the creation of an authentic avionics package. â Importantly, the forthcoming TBMâs will inherit the code base of the preceding Kodiaks and their PC-12. This means a significant portion of the ground work will be completed in advance which will ultimately allow them to focus on other areas. â This is all exciting news and although no price or release date has been announced, Threshold will keep you informed with all this once it becomes available. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PACSIM has recently released their rendition of Salt Lake City International Airport (KSLC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in Utah with a yearly average of 25 million passengers. The airport was built on Basque Flats, a wide flat area on the Salt Lake Valley that was deemed appropriate for constructing a landing strip. In that same year, it held the Great International Aviation Carnival, with the presence of many aviation pioneers, including Glenn Curtiss and his newly invented Seaplane that took off from Salt Lake in front of 20,000 spectators, making international headlines. Nine years later, the United States Postal Service began flying mail to SLC, stimulating the cityâs administration to further improve the infrastructure by buying a plot of land near the airport and building a hangar and other facilities.Â  The first terminal was built in 1933, costing $52,000.Â  With WW2, the airport became a USAF base, eventually getting a third runway. The post-war results were primarily positive, with 42 weekday departures in 1957. By 1960, a new terminal was needed, and Brazier Montmorency Hayes &amp; Talbot took the challenge to design it. Seven years and 8 million dollars later, it was ready to roll. Thatâs also when Salt Lake City got granted its international status, with a direct flight to Calgary. With the airline deregulation in 1978, SLC became a hub for Western Airlines, which had the same Brazier Montmorency Hayes design and build a terminal for them, with murals by artist LeConte Stewart.Â  In 1987, Western Airlines merged into Delta Air Lines, with Salt Lake City remaining as one of their major hubs. A redevelopment program was started in 2014 to modernize the airport, gradually replacing its old infrastructure. It was funded by airport funds, passenger charges, and federal grants. The first phase of the new terminal was opened in 2020, with Concourse A sporting 25 gates and B with 21, both connected by a mid-field underground tunnel.Â  As mentioned, SLC is a Delta Air Lines hub, flying passengers worldwide, directly or indirectly connecting via other hubs. They have 57.12% of the current passenger market share, followed by SkyWest with 18.77% and Southwest with 11.17%. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom animated jetways, sharp PBR textures, VDGS on every gate, high-resolution orthoimagery around the airport, hand-placed vegetation, performance-friendly optimization, wear and tear on runways, taxiways, and aprons, and more. Itâs available on their official website for roughly $25.99. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BMWorld and AmSim have recently released their rendition of Colorado Springs Airport (KCOS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in Colorado with a yearly average of 2 million passengers.  The airport was built in 1927 on 260 hectares of land seven miles east of Colorado Springs, initially featuring two gravel runways. During its initial decade of operations, it was mainly a stop for mail routes flying from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Pueblo, in Colorado.  True regular passenger service would only come in 1937, when Continental operated a route from Denver to El Paso, stopping in Colorado Springs. In 1943, Braniff also added the city to their destination list.  The first passenger terminal was built in 1942, using a modern art deco style. Passengers would only get to use it properly after the war, as the army took control of the airport during that period.  In 1966, another terminal was built and expanded in 1980 with six new gates.Â   Thirty years later, with the growing demand for air travel, the city approved a new terminal with 26,000 square meters of total area and 12 gates. In that same decade, a five-gate concourse was built on the main terminal's east side.  They have been trying to expand service since the 1980s, with the best figures rounding up at around 5 million passengers in 1996. In late 2020, Southwest Airlines announced they would begin serving the airport in 2021, which has helped increase the yearly traffic figures.Â   With the recent growth, the airport administration plans to expand the airport by doubling the number of gates and relocating the control tower.  As of 2022, Southwest Airlines holds most of the passenger market share with 49.84% of the traffic, followed by SkyWest with 23.08% and American Airlines with 14.05%.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution ground textures, custom ground markings, animated jetways, a detailed terminal interior, landside buildings, and FSLTL compatibility.  It's available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.67, requiring at least 2.37 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane.  TearWear Designs has recently released their rendition of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (KCLE) for X-Plane 12, the busiest airport in Ohio with a yearly average of 8.5 million passengers.  Founded in 1925, Cleveland Hopkins International was one of the first municipality-owned airports in the United States, the first airport to ever have an air traffic control tower, the first with a ground-to-air radio control system, and the first to feature a night lighting system. Itâs one of the most historically relevant airports in the world. It was also the first airport directly connected to a local or regional rail system and the first to implement a two-level terminal design separating arrivals from departures.  The airport consists of a two-level passenger terminal, built in the late 70s and renovated in 2016, with four concourses, although only three are currently in use. Concourse A houses Frontier, Spirit, charter flights, and all international arrivals. Concourse B, on the other hand, houses Southwest and Delta. C, the last of the operational concourses, hosts Air Canada Express, Alaska, American, JetBlue, and United. Passenger market share-wise, United leads with 23%, followed by Frontier with 13.76% and Southwest with 12.61%.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as of 2023, with custom-made objects, an intricately designed passenger terminal, true-to-life texturing, a custom mesh designed for compatibility with Ortho4Xp, hand-placed autogen and vegetation, SAM jetways and marshallers, performance-friendly optimization, and a custom prebuilt ortho tile.  Itâs free on theÂ X-Plane.Org Store, requiring at least 3.5 GB of free hard disk space to install (the airport alone takes 1.5GB, and the orthos need an additional 2 GB). â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  Sierrasim has recently released an updated version of their rendition of JosÃ© JoaquÃ­n de Olmedo International Airport (SEGU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Guayaquil in Ecuador with a yearly average of 3.7 million passengers.  The airport was inaugurated in October 1937 as a small airfield, initially serving as a military base.  Sixty-six years later, the airport administration made plans to build a new terminal and extend the runway, both deemed too small for the cityâs needs. At first, they had agreed to build a 28,000-square-meter terminal for international flights while using the old terminal for domestic operations. But later, they settled on a bigger terminal for both, occupying 50,000 square meters.  The current terminal can handle up to 5 million passengers a year. Once it reaches its maximum capacity, there are plans to build a new airport 20km from the city.  Itâs a hub for Avianca Ecuador and LATAM Ecuador, flying people to many destinations in Latin and North America. The visitorsâ list includes American Airlines, Copa Airlines, Iberia, JetBlue, KLM, and Spirit.  The scenery features improvements on all airport models (compared to V1), high-quality PBR textures, custom jetways, terminal interiors, new apron and airport lights, cargo terminal improvements, improved ground textures, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $18.48, requiring at least 845.02MB of free hard disk space to install. V1 owners are entitled to a free upgrade.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PKSIM has recently released their rendition of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport (SKSP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the archipelago of San AndrÃ©s, Providencia, and Santa Catalina, in Colombia with a yearly average of 2 million passengers.  The airport was built in the 1950s to link the airport with continental Colombia by order of President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, whose name is now shared with the airport. Â  â  It was granted its international status in 1993, allowing it to handle international traffic and consequently helping boost the traffic figures, leading to its eventual expansion and modernization in the 2000s.  It is the sole gateway to the island and is essential to local tourism and its residents.  Itâs served by Avianca (BogotÃ¡, MedellÃ­n), Copa Airlines (Panama City), Latam Colombia (BogotÃ¡, Cartagena, and MedellÃ­n), Satena (Providencia), and Wingo (Barranquilla, Cali, and Cartagena).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airports (it also includes the smaller Providencia Airport), with detailed models, custom ground textures, custom GSX config, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $20.13, requiring at least 598.17 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Henderson Executive Airport (KHND) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a public-use government airport in Henderson, Nevada, categorized as a reliever airport by the FAAâs National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems.Â   It was founded in 1967, and built on 912 acres purchased from the city of Henderson, opening three years later as Sky Harbor Airport. It was bought out by Clark County in 1996 and given its current name.  According to 2015 data, the airport had 71,323 operations, with 86% corresponding to general aviation traffic, 14% air taxi, and less than 1% military.Â   The airportâs IATA (HSH) differs from its ICAO because of Tokyo Haneda (HND), forcing it to be one of the few North American airports whose IATA doesnât correspond to the last three digits of its ICAO.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport with PBR texturing, full-detail buildings, high-resolution ground imagery, custom night lighting, high-detail airport vehicles, performance-friendly optimization, custom vegetation, and optional static aircraft.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.25, requiring at least 37.31 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
