    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After releasing a multitude of freeware projects, GotFriends have once again decided to venture into the world of payware, with the announcement of the EA7 Optica, their second payware aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This aircraft is a full remaster of the previous freeware version which released last year. The developer has made it clear, however, that this is built completely from the ground up and includes exciting features such as a KAP140 autopilot and full PMS50 (GTN750) support. Included are âseveral real world liveries the aircraft was most popular for,â an animated cat and dog sitting visibly in the cockpit, and the aforementioned KAP140 autopilot and GTN750 support. It should be noted, however, that currently the TDS GTN750 does not work with this aircraft. Upon its initial release, the aircraft is set to be exclusive to the Flightsim.to store, and will be coming to the MSFS Marketplace (and Xbox) within a month. Furthermore, the aircraft is set to cost $19.99, but will launch with a sale of 50% as a token of appreciation to the community. It was also stated that users should be looking forward to the aircraft releasing sometime next week. For further information make sure to check out the official teaser trailer, as well as the original announcement made on the Flightsim.to website</summary>

    <title>X-Scenery Announces Mitsubishi MU-2B-60 Marquise 2.0</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, X-Plane developer X-Scenery officially announced their latest project - the Mitsubishi MU-2B-60 Marquise 2.0. The aircraft, a completely reinvented version of the developerâs first payware product back in 2008, will serve as nostalgia for longtime X-Plane users while allowing others to enjoy a memorable general aviation experience. According to the developer, the 3D model of the MU-2 has to be redone from the ground up to accommodate for the differences between X-Plane 9, the simulator the first version of the plane was designed for, and X-Plane 11. Improved software technology, hardware capabilities, and workflow have allowed the team to improve the modelâs geometric fidelity and âget the challenging shapes and curves more accurateâ. To illustrate the differences between the two models, the developers included a comparison between the two where the v2 model clearly has âa higher density 3D model all aroundâ. Additionally, higher 3D details have been utilized in certain areas of the aircraft to âreflect light more realistically as [the user] moves the camera aroundâ, an approach that differs from the traditional method of using texture decals which may result in âfake looking 3D modelsâ. To compliment the new model, the developers are also utilizing PBR textures with a solid implementation of ambient occlusion, âa phenomenon where light loses energy as it bounces around into corners, resulting in darker corners and recessesâ. Since ambient occlusion is not provided for aircraft in X-Plane by default, it will be painted, or "baked", into the MU-2's textures. For a full list of improvements in version 2, checkout the developer's post. Finally, the developers teased that additional progress updates that will introduce the users to the MU-2âs cockpit will be published soon, though no specific time frames has been given. Currently, X-Scenery is yet to announce the release date or pricing of the Mitsubishi MU-2. However, the developers did indicate owners of V1 will receive a discount when purchasing MU-2 V2. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After a recent run of previews, Got Friends has released their second payware aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the EA-7 Edgley Optica. The Optica serves as a complete remaster of their previous freeware version, with the developer calling it a âfull reduxâ built from the ground up. The EA-7 Edgley Optica is a single-engine aircraft originally created by Edgley Aircraft Limited, built primarily for aerial observation and as a low-cost solution for helicopters.Â  Powered by a Textron Lycoming IO-540-V4A5D at 260 horsepower, the aircraft is able to reach speeds up to 132mph and is limited to its service ceiling of 14,000 feet. The developer's rendition of the EA-7 Optica boasts various exciting features, such as a KAP140 Autopilot, PMS50 GTN750 support with Working Titleâs extension framework, as well as attachable skis for winter operations, and much more. The full feature list is viewable below. Currently, the aircraft is available for purchase exclusively from the flightsim.to store for a price of $13.20 CAD, which is 50% cheaper than its original price of $26.40 CAD. However, the aircraft will also be available via the MSFS Marketplace and Xbox in the coming months.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Umberto Colapicchioni dropped a second preview on his YouTube Channel regarding GSX for Microsoft Flight Simulator, showcasing the product's pushback procedures and animations, whilst the upcoming product is in its alpha build stage of development. This video starts off with Umberto summoning the GSX menu, and from eyeshot, viewers can see a variety of options from the menu. Items such as catering, refueling, boarding, and jetways are all shown in the UI along with other options the plugin is known for in its P3D and FSX counterparts.  After clicking on the pushback option, viewers see a handling operator menu, giving users the option to choose what air carrier operation pushes them back from the gate. The options included in the video are British Airways, Easyjet (both white and orange logos), and Virgin Atlantic. After choosing one of the options, viewers then can see a pushback tug pulling up to the aircraft, involving a ground crew member, fully animated.  After that, the aircraft pushes back, and once again, ground crew animations are fully animated, along with realistic flags and such being animated, and modeled.Â  FSDreamTeam did add a disclaimer that the product is in its Alpha version with features being subjected to change. Alongside this, no price or release date was announced by the development team.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, aircraft developer PMDG has published a new update on its much anticipated 737-700 project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, discussing the status of the aircraftâs testing, developmental progress, and upcoming plans. According to the developers, the testing of the aircraft continues smoothly, with some 70 issues reported by the testers and more than 120 solved by the development team. However, despite the 737 currently performing at a near satisfactory level, the developers expressed their frustration that MSFS currently lacks âtools that [they] would normally use to improve code stability and look for areas that require optimizationâ, preventing them from gaining vital insights on key areas needing improvements. In addition to updates on testing, the team also shined light on their current task of improving the details of some areas âto evaluate the impact different techniques may have on the performance of the simulatorâ. The developers are trying to gradually increase the level of details without sacrificing any performance, a process aided by their âincreased confidence in Asobo's rendering engineâ.Â The developer's progress is demonstrated by the completely rebuilt fire handles and light knobs pictured above. Finally, the developers revealed that a âfull bore promotional processâ will soon start, presenting the public with additional details on the aircraft and answering their questions. Currently, PMDG has not revealed the release date of the aircraft, claiming that its carefully designed workflow and testing procedure currently prevent it from determining a precise date. However, the developers teased that the 737 is âvery close to that pointâ where a firm release date can be set and the embargo can be lifted for beta testers. â</summary>
