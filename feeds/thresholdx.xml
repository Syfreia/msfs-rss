    <title> PMDG Publishes 737 For MSFS Preview Trailer</title>
    <updated>2022-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG Simulations has posted a new preview trailer of their 737 for MSFS in action on their YouTube channel. The highly anticipated aircraft has seen some major progress as of late, most recently having entered the beta stage of testing. Similar to its counterpart in Prepar3D, the aircraft will come delivered with every feature as is possible to simulate in MSFS. No release date has been set yet, but the community will be notified of the team's release intentions once the details are concrete.Â  The preview trailer showcases the many views the 737 possesses, presenting the exterior, cockpit, cargo operations, as well as passenger views. Viewers are also able to witness all of the systems in action, as well as the aircraft in a flying state. Itâs imperative to mention, though, that the aircraft is still in active development, therefore systems may be altered from their state in the video. Another subtle but important detail is PMDGâs acknowledgement of MAX development for MSFS. In the description of the video, the author mentions that the product line will âinclude the entire third and fourth generation 737 series from the 737-600 to the 737-10â. No additional details were given as to the development status of the MAX, so ensure that you keep up to date with future articles entailing information about their future products.Â  âAnother Dev Update! Robert Randazzo added to the trailer by posting a new development update. At this point in time, the team is cleaning up the aircraft, bugs are being attended to, and the beta is in full swing. Beta testers are still bound to their Non Disclosure Agreement for the time being, but PMDG expects the testers to be able to share media of the plane in the coming weeks. Luckily, the aircraft is in a better state than expected, which infers a more imminent release.Â  If youâre not caught up with PMDGâs 737 development for MSFS, take a look at this previous article here outlining its beta testing and future progress.</summary>

    <title>A Recap of Flight Factorâs latest 777V2 previews</title>
    <updated>2022-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlightFactor has been chipping away at several projects, their front-running project being the 777, kickstarting 2022, the team went on a tour with 777v2 updates these past few weeks, dropping several previews and showcasing different aspects and areas of the aircraft. Their latest update takes us to the seat of the cabin, with a rendition that will certainly have you live the exciting moments in a 777: For the bourgeoisie sitting in the forward cabin, FlightFactor has reproduced a highly impressive business class cabin: Emirates undoubtedly has one of the most distinctive and luxurious cabin interiors in the skies; their wooden lacquer window frames and chic cream upholstery serves as a basis for their standard interior modelling amongst a few other options users will be able to choose from. Flight Factor has additionally began modelling some mood lighting across the cabin, shown below: A common argument that frequently appears across all simulation platforms is the idea that cabins are not necessary, and while they don't impact the actual piloting aspect, many enjoy the depth and immersiveness it brings - modern X-Plane airliners all feature a modelled cabin to various degrees of detail. Itâs great to see FlightFactor continue the increasingly popular âcabin cultureâ within X-Plane; no longer will users feel their calming boarding music will be played in vain, now with a cabin to match. On the exterior, FlightFactor has taken a page out of CaptainSim by modelling in operable hatches and service doors across the plane, their most recent example being fully functioning engine cowlings. To date, no other airliner in X-Plane has implemented such a detailed visual model for an airliner. This alone will certainly be a selling point for FlightFactor as it's this type of attention to detail that really touches the buyer's stimulus: Complementing pre-flight inspections, the team has posted a short clip demonstrating animated workers scattered on the apron - bringing some life to the beginning of your flight: Needless to say, this aircraft is generating a lot of noise within the X-Plane community, as it replicates one of the most popular twinjet airliners Boeing has ever made, and is a much-needed replacement to their original product that dates back in X-Plane 9âs final days. For more updates, check out Flight Factorâs Twitter page and be sure to stay tuned, as we will bring you the latest news and updates when available.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. First announced in November of 2020, Leonardo has undergone active development of itâs incredible McDonnell Douglas MD-80 for the new simulator. Itâs been a couple months since weâve last heard from the team, but recently, Stefan subtly commented on the Maddog X forum that the aircraft is currently in itâs beta stage, and the software is progressing well.Â  Leonardoâs MD-80 was originally developed for Prepar3Dv4 and FSX. Itâs widely considered by the flight simulation community to be one of the best airliners available for any simulator platform, and arguably the best MD-80 available, period. The aircraft delivers fully simulated failures, accurate systems, superb modeling, and a proactive development team.Â  Reverting back to the MSFS compatible MD-80, the team has shared a few videos on its YouTube channel, showcasing the aircraft in action. Other than their videos and promising comments regarding the aircraftâs development progress, though, we havenât received any additional information surrounding its release.Â  Stefano mentioned that more details will follow this announcement, make sure to keep up to date with Leonardoâs progress on their forums, as well as with us here at Threshold.Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Up-and-coming aircraft developer BlueBird Simulations has announced their first project for flight simulation, the Boeing 757. The team contains four dedicated members, including a programmer with a plethora of experience, two model designers, and an airline pilot. Just Flight will be supporting the 757 development efforts. BlueBird informed the community that âthis will be a mid-level complexity aircraft which will be several layers more complex than default airliners.â â BlueBird Simulations intends for the 757 to be an MSFS-native aircraft to fully utilize the SDK. As of now, the aircraft is still in the early stages of systems development, but more information will be disclosed later, when the team has more progress to share. Itâs important to contextualize the recurrent theme of âassuming release datesâ by pointing out that development times may change over the course of time if the developer feels its necessary, but BlueBird is confident that the 757 will find itself on the market in the first half of 2023.Â  Head over to the BlueBird Simulations website to visit the original update post, additionally check Just Flight's Facebook post for more images of the 757âs current exterior, and to keep current with the âflying pencilsâ progress.Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. As the addons list for MSFS continues to grow, it has been refreshing to see a utility product amongst all the scenery and aircraft hype. With TDS Simâs flagship product, itâs a simulated fourth generation Garmin GTNXI: an answer to the complaints and concerns over MSFS native navigation systems that have, according to the community, long been one the simulators short falls - its latest update is certainly arriving with much anticipation. Recently, TDS Sim announced that their product for MSFS can now be experienced through Virtual Cockpits with added VC and VR support.Â  Now armed with these new capabilities and an expanding list of compatible aircraft, the product's future developments appear promising. The aircraft that will initially support this added VR and VC ability will be the Just Flight PA28 collection, followed by the upcoming SimWorks Studios RV-14, as well as the FlySimWare C414. Integration of the product and the added functionality will be dependent on external aircraft developers and their willingness to adopt TDS Simâs SDK.Â  In true Garmin fashion, the GTNXi is packed with some really impressive features that will give the pilots who utilize it the upper hand. This experience is now heightened with the recently added capabilities; if you are not a current user of the GTNXi, and are a VR user or simply someone who prefers complete VC integration, then maybe the prospect of this product now working for you may spark some interest. Luckily weâre here to give you a quick insight on what this product entails. It is evident that the team has really gone to great lengths to ensure no function has been forgotten. What we have seen from the team recently proves their willingness to constantly build on their existing products, meaning we can be sure to see future updates. Take a look at some of their more interesting features amongst many, that we thought are worth highlighting: Some noteworthy mentions: the product contains both the 650Xi and the 750Xi so thereâs no need to purchase them individually. Should you decide to go ahead and purchase the product, the team has expressed their focus in keeping the product optimized so that performance of the flight simulator remains unimpacted, we know this is important. The installation of similar products in the past have always notoriously been tricky, however TDS claims their installation process is as simple as running a standalone exe file. Should you require further information check out the product page for an extensive breakdown, potential users can expect all the usual Garmin functions and much more. The product is currently on sale at 39.95 EUR, typically costing 49.95 EUR and can be purchased on TDS Simâs website.</summary>

SimSolutionâs appears to have done a great job in recreating one of aviation's most adored aircraft, this STOL aircraft has long been known for its versatility and agility, capable of unthinkable maneuvers. For pilots looking for an aircraft to just have fun with, this was and still is it. SimSolutions claims to have modeled this aircraft with high resolution textures, which is demonstrated in their provided images. Accurate flight characteristics is another promise made by the developers, meaning you can do all the same crazy low speed maneuvers you've seen these aircraft do in those viral videos. The Product comes with three configurations, namely: Standard Tires, Tundra Tires and Floats. With this, the aircraft includes a number of quirky features such as a custom hand held radio, hand propping ability, and toggleable covers. See below their full Feature list: In addition to all this, what could be considered a minor yet appreciated feature is the provided CSL model for Vatsim use.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx returns to city-making, taking focus off aviation and essentially bringing the maritime scene in MSFS to life with the release of Landmarks Panama City Pack. This well known city is an important supply route, saving mariners the need to navigate the notoriously treacherous waters around the southernmost tip of South America, known as Cape Horn. The city is most recognisable by the canal that enables ships to take this short cut and shave around 8,100 miles off their voyage.Â  Looking at their provided images, itâs safe to say this scenery looks impeccable, with the usual level of detail we have come to expect of Orbx. Although this location is mainly known for the Panama Canal, it must be said that the canal itself certainly was not their only focus. For the most part, the surrounding city and its landmarks are modeled, and done so accurately. From High rises to stadiums and all the vegetation between, Orbx assures customers this is a âmust-have scenery upgradeâ. See their full key feature list below: Unlike the Panama Papers, it appears this scenery will not disappoint. With such a large area covered, this product should leave users with much to be explored. Should you be interested, this can be purchased at $9.80 USD on the Orbx website. Check out their facebook page for further updates and comments.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Simmy Aircraft, a newcomer to the X-Plane community, is currently well underway in developing their maiden product, a DA42VI. Having worked and contributed to numerous projects including, LevelUp, Toliss, TFDi, X-Bureau and Magknight, it is evident the team themselves are anything but new. By participating in the production of some of our favorite aircraft, we can be hopeful to see similar qualities in their products. Their early work in progress images show an already stunning strong start, Simmy's has provided Threshold with a fresh set of new images to feature: The team have stated that their primary goal is to provide a product that can be utilized in a manner that aids training. Itâs no secret the DA42 is widely used across the world as a modern twin engine training option, making this a great aircraft to have virtualized, especially considering so many students are actively training on it. With this in mind, the team have expressed that in conjunction to creating a visually immaculate model, the accuracy of flight behaviors and system depth, are at the forefront of their priorities.Â  Looking at the current team of two, it is interesting to note that both members are actively training. With one currently working on his Multi-engine commercial license on the DA42, and the other beginning their flight instructor training. This is a key point, given the fact that both developers know what students want and need from such a simulation, as they both approach this project from the perspective of a student. This in itself gives this team an upper hand, which we hope reflects in the end product.Â  With the aircraft aimed at the upcoming X-Plane 12 platform, this could very well be one of the simulators' very first native payware. Leading the way with a fresh new plane in a fresh new sim. For more information stay tuned, and weâll be sure to bring you the latest when made available.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. VerticalSim has released the visual rendition of Syracuse Airport (KSYR) for X-Plane 11 just 3 months after the initial release of Boise Airport for the same client. The developerâs scenery style has finally reached the Empire State. Syracuse Airport is locate near the city of Syracuse, New York. After land was purchased in 1928, a small airfield was constructed to service airmail carriers. After World War 2, the Army Air Corps leased the local bomber base near the small airfield, which then further transformed into the Clarence E. Hancock Airport in 1949. At the time of opening, the airport had four airlines basing routes in and out of the airfield, which included but are not limited to, American Airlines and Mohawk Airlines. Today, the airport receives both passenger and cargo operations. This visual rendition offers many qualities that VerticalSim has made standard in all of its releases. Right out of the box, 4K PBR textures and HDR night lighting have been included, alongside the airport's current layout as of 2022. SAM Jetway support and animated vehicle traffic have also been added to enhance the userâs experience. Lastly, taxi routes are available for AI Traffic addons. The full feature list has been provided upon release: If you are interested in purchasing this scenery, you can find it on VerticalSimâs Store Page for $19.99.
