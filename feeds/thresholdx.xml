    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, developer iniBuilds has announced their plans of bringing their existing aircrafts to X-Plane 12, focusing exclusively on their much-popular A300. According to the developers, the A300V2 will soon receive an update that makes the plane compatible with X-Plane 12. All existing owners of the aircraft will be able to update free of charge. In addition, a significant reduction in price for the entire family is planned, though the developer didnât offer any details regarding this planned price change. However, the developers have decided to not provide a release date for the compatibility update, though they hinted that it is expected to come in early 2023. Though the date seems far in the future, the developers reasoned that their current focus is to improve and polish the A300.  Currently, the A300V2 is on sale and can be purchased on iniBuilds webstore for Â£34.99 GBP, or $40.5 USD. Threshold will keep you updated on future iniBuild news.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Aero Dynamics team has published a new quarterly drop on theirÂ Discord server, showcasing the current state of their freeware KC-10/DC-10 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with extensive focus on their 3D scanned cockpit. It is said to feature swappable instruments to provide both the OG experience and a modern flight suite, along with an EFB that will allow users to customize the cockpit settings, handle ground services, checklists, Navigraph and SimBrief integration, and OSM maps.   Regarding displays and systems, they have managed to integrate the fuel gauges into the aircraft, with upgrades to the font accuracy coming in the near future. Further progress with the electrical system has made viable work on a more advanced fuel system and the APU, with pneumatic and hydraulic systems to follow. They have also showcased two new models, the DC-10-30F (freighter) and the 10 Tanker. The 10F is their first DC-10 variant, featuring nine liveries, including FedEx (old and new), Aeroflot, and United. The latter is a tanker, capable of dropping fire retardant with the press of a button! â Credits to AllNaturalBlue for the news scoop.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The team at Laminar Research has formally announced that the full release of X-Plane 12 will occur sometime in December.

The team at Laminar Research is confident in pushing the release of XP12 to other medians such as DVD disks, though the release of a disk will be available in early 2023. Many people are looking forward to an improved Airbus A330 with a custom MCDU instead of the default XP FMS. Laminar did provide screenshots of the MCDU to attendees, showcasing what has been worked on. Many are excited for Laminar to release the next-gen simulator fully, whilst some believe that it is a very optimistic decision on Laminarâs part. Though, it was disclosed that work will continue on the alpha version before the final release. â Threshold will keep you updated on further developments.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has just released their rendition of Telluride Regional Airport (KTEX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the highest commercial airport in the United States, and the second highest overall in the country, only behind Leadville Airport. The yearly passenger figures are around 17.000, with Denver being the most popular destination in terms of sheer volume.Â   The airport is famous for providing a challenging approach because of the surrounding geography, runway length, and steep glide path angle (3.55 on 9 and 4.0 on 27). The 2167 meters of runway feel a lot shorter because of the elevation.Â   The scenery features high-detail buildings, realistic ground markings, high-resolution ground imagery, night effects, FPS-oriented optimization, custom vegetation, PBR materials, both tower and terminal with a modeled interior, and optional static aircraft.  Itâs available onÂ FlightSim.toÂ for $9.99 and on theirÂ websiteÂ for Â£9.99, requiring at least 105 MB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
