    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The all-new rendition of the F-19 Stealth fighter has been released for X-Plane 12. This release adds to the ever-increasing and vast library of military aircraft a part of the new next-generation simulator. With the ever-increasing aircraft network being moved to the new simulator, the F-19 Stealth Fighter Project is no different. Attempting to recreate the 80s aircraft to the best of their abilities, VSKYLABS has not only replicated the exterior model but also developed the systems and the interior. The developers have provided an extensive feature list. Starting off, they have replicated the flight model of the actual aircraft with XP12âs flight dynamics upgrade. Along with FMOD sounds being included, the aircraft has been developed to be compatible with VR and optimized for 2D usage. For the full feature list, you can view it on the product page. If you are interested in picking this aircraft up for yourself, you can purchase it on VSKYLABS Website. Though the developer has stated that it is not an official release, the project is under constant maintenance.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. DarkSpace has just released xEnviro 2020, a brand new weather engine aiming to improve the weather depiction in Microsoft Flight Simulator, built upon their ten years of experience developing xEnviro for X-Plane. With a shared core code based on two decades of atmospheric studies and a sophisticated mathematical model, it aims to bring professional class weather simulation to everyone. On the announcement thread, they have also stated their long-term plans for the product, which will initially feature the engine itself and historical weather* (first weather add-on to feature historical weather), but with a - potential - addition of true-scale clouds that are already available on their version for X-Plane. They also mention that MSFS depicts weather differently due to how the clouds are scaled (twice as big), meaning some very specific METARs canât be faithfully reproduced as of yet (the announcement features an example). The complete feature list follows down below: Features Itâs available on the Threshold Store for $42, and xEnviro (X-Plane) owners get a $20 discount.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! *Historical Weather from 16.10.2022 and beyond</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Releases New A320 Update</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently updated their A320 add-on to v1.0.5.139, addressing a significant list of issues, including flare law tweaks, flap behavior, sound fixes, and the return of contrails. There is an in-depth forum postÂ regarding their findings on the landing behavior, including comparisons with real-world data and footage, which can be a worthwhile read for A320 aficionados. The complete changelog follows down below: â [SYSTEM] â - Adjusted custom low speed friction model â - Adjusted G/S mini logic â - Fixed beacon/strobe desync â - Fixed flap 2 to flap 3 excessive nose-down ballooning in manual flight and autoflight. â - Adjusted tuning for G/S hold for better tracking of G/S in autopilot modes â - Autoland told to stop mucking about and do the job properly, should flare a little more aggressively now. â - Fixed issue with loss of ILS signal in the FMS autotuner. This causes lack of yaw control during ROLLOUT, leading to grassy excursions. Please note, it's possible this issue still exists in specific sceneries that do not have their guidance beams set up properly. â - ISA fixed. â - Small tweaks to FLARE mode behaviour. â - Introduction of LIGHTER/HEAVIER sidestick option in CONTROL CONFIG, default changed to "lighter" for desktop hardware.Â  â - Changed amount of force needed to disconnect autopilot with stick pressure. Now a user needs to apply roughly 60% of travel before the AP will disconnect. This is the best way we can emulate a "control lock" which requires a fair amount of force to disconnect. â - Disabled brake temperature simulation for GSX pushbacks. â - Reduced sensitivity of yaw when nose wheel is in contact with the ground, leading to significantly smoother yaw control during crosswind landings and at high speeds. â - Minor refinements to initial VNAV descent angle calculations.Â  â - Fixed issue where the flat deceleration segment for 250kts was missing when a "at or above" altitude constraint was present. â [FM] â - Slight bump to flap full lift, aircraft should feel more responsive in flap full configurations, ergo FLARE feels slightly more energetic now as opposed to throwing elevator up into a bowl of porridge. All in, this should be more consistent, simply put. The prior the lack of lift was causing inertia issues. Please be aware of this on your next approach, some refamiliarization might be required. â - Made a small adjustment to lateral friction values â - Made a small adjustment to ground spoiler effectiveness â [ART&amp;SOUND] â - All exterior lights now volumetric â - Added back missing antennas â - #bringbackcontrails â - Volume bug resolved preventing some sounds from playing at their intended volume â - Fixed nose gear retraction sounds â - Brighter cockpit â - Sound fixes and improvements (flaps/slats/fuel-pumps/AEVC/packs) The update is available on their website for registered customers.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, developer iniBuilds has announced their plans of bringing their existing aircrafts to X-Plane 12, focusing exclusively on their much-popular A300. According to the developers, the A300V2 will soon receive an update that makes the plane compatible with X-Plane 12. All existing owners of the aircraft will be able to update free of charge. In addition, a significant reduction in price for the entire family is planned, though the developer didnât offer any details regarding this planned price change. However, the developers have decided to not provide a release date for the compatibility update, though they hinted that it is expected to come in early 2023. Though the date seems far in the future, the developers reasoned that their current focus is to improve and polish the A300.

Regarding displays and systems, they have managed to integrate the fuel gauges into the aircraft, with upgrades to the font accuracy coming in the near future. Further progress with the electrical system has made viable work on a more advanced fuel system and the APU, with pneumatic and hydraulic systems to follow. They have also showcased two new models, the DC-10-30F (freighter) and the 10 Tanker. The 10F is their first DC-10 variant, featuring nine liveries, including FedEx (old and new), Aeroflot, and United.
