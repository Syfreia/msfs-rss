    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Nashville International Airport (KBNA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Nashville Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 18 million passengers.  Opened in June 1937, passenger service started a month later with American Airlines and Eastern Air Lines. It originally featured three runways, a three-story passenger terminal, a control tower, two hangars, and a beacon. The yearly figures hit nearly 190,000 passengers.  It was used as the headquarters for the 4th Ferrying Command during World War 2, ferrying aircraft to Europe at the height of the war. The ferrying operations demanded a lot of space, which implied an expansion to 1,500 acres of total area.Â   Nearly a decade later, the City Aviation Department made plans to modernize and expand the airport, with a new terminal, runway expansion, and a new crosswind runway to come in 1961.  As a curiosity, Nashville Intl. was the first municipal airport in the United States with a public reading room.Â   It has seen a lot of expansion work over the following years, with its peak in the late 1980s, when American Airlines made a hub in Nashville and attracted many companies to the city, such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation. The hub eventually closed in 1995, when American couldnât afford to lose any more money (it wasnât profitable even during its heyday).Â   The airport has been recently modernized, with operations starting in 2006 and reaching its conclusion five years later, expanding the ticketing and check-in areas, renovating and constructing new bathrooms, and bringing the total size of the terminal to 1 million square feet. In 2021, the operator made a plan called âNew Horizonâ to further improve the airport, at the cost of 1.5 billion USD. Construction is set to begin in 2023 and reach completion in late 2028.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with over a hundred custom-modeled buildings, taxi bridges, custom night lighting, custom jetways, and custom ground polygon.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ and onÂ FeelThereâs ShopÂ for $21.39/$19.99 (respectively), requiring at least 609 MB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Realworldscenery has recently released their rendition of Fairbanks International Airport (PAFA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Fairbanks (Alaska), the smallest city in the country with regularly scheduled non-stop international flights.  The airportâs history dates back to 1951, when it replaced Ladd Army Airfield as the gateway to Fairbanks, serving as Alaska Airlinesâ main hub up until 1967 when they moved to Anchorage, yet keeping the Anchorage - Fairbanks service. It was also an important stopover for Braniff International, Pan American World Airways, American Airlines, and Western Airlines in the 60s and 70s. To conform with the current TSA standards, the original terminal (from 1948) was entirely demolished and replaced by a brand new one in late 2009, featuring better design and security, an extra jetway bridge (six instead of five), handling an average of 1 million passengers per year.  Itâs the hub for Everts Air, operating scheduled and charter airline cargo all across Alaska and Canada with a fleet of classic aircraft, including the C-46, the Douglas DC-6, and the Douglas MD-83. It also hosts Warbelowâs Air Ventures and Wright Air Service. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, custom-made buildings, performance-friendly optimization, and a realistic taxiway layout.  Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $18.58, requiring at least 1.3 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Salvuz has recently released their rendition of Bergen Airport (ENBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in Norway with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  Dating back to the early 1950s, Bergen Airport was partially funded by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana with 4 million Norwegian kroner, securing the construction of a terminal and a 1,460-meter-long runway. NATO funded an expansion in 1953, warranting a 2,440-meter-long runway instead. When the first flight landed at the airport in mid-1954, only 800 meters of it were complete. It was a chartered flight from Bergen to Oslo, transporting a local football team.  Itâs a hub for Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e, with an extensive domestic and intra-European network. According to 2014 data, Scandinavian Airlines had 46% of the market share for domestic flights, Norwegian had 38%, and WiderÃ¸e 15%. International-wise, Norwegian led the way with 36%, SAS had 23%, and KLM with 18% (with a single route to Amsterdam).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, sporting handcrafted buildings and facilities with detailed interiors, PBR texturing in 2K or 4K, two custom jetway models, precise terrain markings according to the latest charts, sloped runways with accurate altitude profiles, and parking stands as per latest AIP charts.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of the Bf108 Taifun for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a single-engine sport aircraft from the early 1930s.Â   Designed to compete in the 4th Challenge International de Tourisme in 1934, a major aviation event in pre-war Europe held in Warsaw, Poland, the Taifun was then just a prototype called M34, powered by a 247 horsepower Hirth HM 8U V8 engine, which didnât manage to win the event but impressed with a low fuel consumption rate, good handling and itâs superb take-off/landing characteristics.  The Bf108a, the first variant, took off for the first time in that same year, powered by three different engines (on different airframes): the original Hirth HM 8U, the Argus As 17B with 217 hp, and later units had a Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial, with 158hp. The Bf108b was a revision whose prototype rocked a Siemens-Halske Sh 14a radial, but the production units had either the Argus AS 10C (237hp) or the Argus AS 10E (266hp).  iniBuildsâ second classic aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator makes use of the latest CFD technology including the primary flight surfaces, control surfaces, and the propeller. It also simulates unique characteristics of the airplane such as the capability of landing as slow as 45 knots thanks to its advanced leading edge slats. Such slow speed allows it to operate on very short runways.  The engine is accurately reproduced with its correct performance and behavior, with a fully modeled and functional fuel system that makes use of the new fuel mechanics offered by the simulator.Â   A custom electronic flight bag allows for folding and unfolding the wings, opening storage compartments, choosing a custom rain cover, and changing the cockpit labels from German to English and from metric to imperial. It also features a moving map, weather information, a maintenance page, and other settings.  The aircraft is available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $18.01, requiring at least 2.66 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MM Simulations has recently released their rendition of Turku Airport (EFTU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Turku in Finland with a yearly average of 450,000 passengers, making it the fourth busiest airport in the country. Located in the airport district in the Maaria-Paatinen ward, which is the most sparsely populated district in Turku and includes half of the cityâs area, it was built in 1955 when it was still part of Rusko, becoming part of Turku three years later.  Turku Airport underwent a heavy renovation process in mid-2014 when Finavia spent over 14 million euros on improving Terminal One and the passenger apron. Terminal 2 was closed and demolished a year later after an oil leakage, concentrating the low-cost operations on the first floor of the main terminal. Itâs currently served by six different airlines: AirBaltic (Riga), Amapola Flyg (Mariehamn), Finnair (Helsinki), Scandinavian Airlines (Stockholm-Arlanda), Sunclass Airlines (seasonal legs to Gran Canaria and Tenerife South), and WizzAir (Gdansk and Rome Fiumicino). Gdansk is the busiest route as of 2019, with 117,261 passengers, followed by Helsinki and Stockholm, with 100,086 and 86,331, respectively. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with updated CGL data, real-world-based terraforming profile, PBR materials, ambient animated objects, custom interior modeling, and custom 3D people.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RDPresets has recently released their rendition of Gibraltar International Airport (LXGB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fifth most extreme airport in the World according to the History ChannelâsÂ Most Extreme Airports.Â Â   Dating back to early World War 2, it was built as an emergency airfield for the British Royal Navy, with runway extensions to happen later on once some of the land was reclaimed by using rocks from the Rock of Gibraltar (what remained of carving military tunnels).Â   The airport saw most of its business flourish in the early 2000s when Monarch began flying from Manchester. Iberia, easyJet, and British Airways followed suit not soon after. Nowadays, British Airways and easyJet are the only two airlines serving Gibraltar frequently with routes to London-Heathrow (BA) and Bristol, London Gatwick, and Manchester (EZY), roughing up to 400,000 passengers a year.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom models, PBR texturing, a terminal interior with 3D passengers, more than a thousand clutter objects, realistic and functioning runway crossing (cars stop when turning the strobe light on), custom ground textures, performance-friendly optimization, accurate night lighting, custom taxiway signage, custom ground traffic, and over twenty animations.Â   Itâs available on theÂ RDPresets StoreÂ andÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $21.13/$19.02, respectively. At least 1.3 GB of free disk space is required to install the product. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently updated their 737 lineup to version 3.00.0063 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing a range of minor fixes and improvements along with an Operations Center update.  In order to update the product, customers have to manually update the Operations Center, as the automatic update system is not working. The instructions are available on the announcement postÂ here.Â   As previously mentioned, itâs a minor update with improvements to the whole lineup with the intent to "move the quality forward", as stated by the CEO. The complete changelog follows down below:  â After the release of the -900, they claim to focus on general fixes, updates to the existing logic, and merging in the new navdata. Work also continues on the Universal Flight Tablet. They finished off with a note on the MSFS Beta Channel, especially regarding the SU12 compatibility, where it's stated they might hold off on updates until SU12 is out to the public, with an eventual beta channel on the Operations Center that would allow PMDG to push updates to both stable and beta (something for the future after the tablet is out and they are happy with all the pending improvements). Â  The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600), $49.99 (737-900), and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Pictures are courtesy of Pineapple_Wizard.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Borneo Wonder Sceneries has recently released their rendition of Sandakan Airport (WBKS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Sandakan, the capital of the Sandakan District in Sabah, Malaysia.Â   Sandakan Airportâs history dates back to World War 2 when the Royal Air Force picked the site to build an airfield but didnât actually get to do much other than get rid of the vegetation before the Japanese invasion of Borneo. The Japanese Army, on the other hand, needed a refueling stop between the peninsular Malaya and the Philippines, transferring over 1,500 prisoners of war from the UK and Australia to work on the construction. Work started in August 1942 and saw partial completion by December of that same year, when a bomber aircraft landed in Sandakan for the first time, opening it for service.Â   The runway was recently extended to 2,500m, with an expansion plan that goes all the way back to 2017, with operations commencing in 2019 but delayed due to the pandemic and finally reaching completion in 2022, allowing the operation of popular narrowbody aircraft like the B737, A320, and the A321. Widebody aircraft can also operate on it with payload/range restrictions.Â   Itâs served by AirAsia (Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur), Malaysia Airlines (Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur), and MASwings (Kudat, Lahad Datu, Tawau), averaging around 900,000 passengers yearly.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a fully modeled terminal (including interior), landside buildings, custom ground textures, custom ground markings, and a custom jetway model.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $11.63, requiring at least 899 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlightFactor's A320 has been one of the most popular and well-regarded flight simulation aircraft for some time. The latest update to the A320 includes several improvements and fixes that enhance the overall experience of flying the plane. In this news article, we will take a closer look at the improvements and fixes introduced in the update. Cabin Visual Improvements: One of the most notable improvements in this update is the enhancement of the cabin visuals. The update brings improvements to the cabin, which helps to create a more immersive experience. These improvements make the cabin feel more realistic and add to the overall realism of the aircraft. Fixes: The update also includes several fixes which address issues that were present in previous versions of the addon. Some of these fixes are: â Dimmed Cabin Floor Light Stripe: One of the issues addressed in this update is the floor light stripe. The update fixes this issue and ensures that the light stripe appears as intended. â VSW Stuck and Not Moving: Another issue addressed in this update is the VSW stuck and not moving. The VSW (Vertical Speed Wheel) is an essential component of the aircraft, and when it gets stuck, it can cause problems for the pilot. The update fixes this issue and ensures that the VSW operates correctly. â Overspeed Protection Too Aggressive: The overspeed protection in the A320 was too aggressive, which meant that the aircraft would automatically reduce its speed even when it was not necessary. This update fixes this issue and ensures that the overspeed protection operates as intended. â Missed Doors in XP11 Version: In the XP11 version of the A320, some doors were missing. The update fixes this issue and ensures that all doors are present and functioning correctly. â Missed Internal Lights in the Cockpit and Cabin in XP11 Version: Another issue in the XP11 version was the missed internal lights in the cockpit and cabin. The update fixes this issue and ensures that all internal lights are present and working correctly. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The flight sim world is abuzz with excitement following the release of the AN225 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The AN225 Mriya, which means "Dream" in Ukrainian, is the world's largest aircraft and has a fascinating history. The INI Builds team along with Microsoft Flight sim has meticulously recreated this sorely missed behemoth of the skies in stunning detail, giving players the chance to experience what it's like to fly this iconic aircraft. The AN225 was originally designed in the Soviet Union in the 1980s as a heavy-lift transport aircraft for military and civilian use. The AN225 was used to transport the Soviet space shuttle, Buran, and was still used up until last year for heavy cargo transport, it was unfortunately destroyed in the ongoing Ukraine war. INI Builds has captured the essence of this aircraft in their simulation, from its massive wingspan to the distinctive six engines that power it. Pilots who purchase the MSFS/ INI Builds AN225 can experience the unique challenges of handling such a large and powerful machine. With great flight physics and attention to detail, the AN225 is sure to become a favourite among flight simulator pilots. MSFS have stated that 100% of the funds received from pilots who purchase the AN225 will go toward the cost of rebuilding the real aircraft.Â  You can pick up the AN225 on the MSFS store for just $19.99Â </summary>
