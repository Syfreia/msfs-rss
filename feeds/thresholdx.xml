    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently previewed the progress on their Dublin Airport (EIDW) upgrade for X-Plane 11 and 12, which adds the new runway (10L/28R), new fencing models, improved ground textures, and more.  Dublin Airport is the 12th busiest airport in Europe, and the 1st in Ireland, with a yearly average of 30 million passengers. It hosts their flag carrier Aer Lingus, the low-cost carrier beast Ryanair, and TUI Airways, with a significant route network that encompasses most of Europe and some key cities in North America.Â   According to BoundlessâÂ development reportÂ from late January, the update will bring full X-Plane 12 compatibility, new overhauled lighting (based on real-life reference imagery from 2023), the integration of the new runway, light tone updates on the Ryanair pier and Terminal 1, road traffic (XP12 only), airside traffic (XP12 only), new fence models, new ground textures, partial photorealistic textures based on 2023 imagery, FPS improvements, ortho updates to match the current state of the airport, general bug fixes, added barriers/fencing, new ground service equipment vehicles with 2023 liveries, road network improvements, better ortho and road network blending with default landclass, and the addition of road details. The developers even visited the airport to take reference pictures for the update, to warrant maximum acuity with the real-life counterpart.  Thereâs no information on a potential release date yet, but they claim it should be out in a few days. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MSFS scenery developers FLIGHTBEAM Studios have recently issued a progress update on their upcoming expansions for the KDEN scenery. The updates will be focused on matching the continuing improvement/ expansion work at the real Denver international airport.Â  The team at FLIGHTBEAM have gone on to say: âI've (FLIGHTBEAM) been extremely fortunate to have some amazing customers who work at the airport, send me a slew of previous photos of the massive expansions happening at the airport. It's become apparent that this is by far one of the biggest real-world expansions at an airport I've seen in some timeâ As a result of the sheer scale of the work happening at Denver airport, FLIGHTBEAM has decided to issue their updates in 2 to 3 parts which will each focus on progressing the scenery along. They have disclosed that not only will the airport expansions be the focus of the scenery updates, but they will also be updating each terminal already in the scenery to a new and even higher standard. This includes - New 4k textures and updated PBR, exterior modelling upgrades, an entirely new interior, completely re-made from scratch and brand new Flightbeam Gen-5 Jetways at each gate to name just a few new features.Â  Although a date has not been revealed for the first part of this update, FLIGHTBEAM have ensured their customers that it will be soon. We will keep you updated as this develops here at Threshold.Â  â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Reveals Planned Release Date for 737-900</title>
    <updated>2023-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmd900" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG made aÂ forum announcementÂ with further information on the upcoming 737-900 package for Microsoft Flight Simulator, set to feature both the 737-900 and the 737-900ER with blended winglets and split scimitar winglets.  They have recently sent a beta build to their testers (which they hope to be the last one before release), with plans to release it next Tuesday (07/02) unless a major issue is found. Regarding pricing, itâs expected to be somewhere between the 600 and the 700/800.Â   The entire 737 lineup is set to get an update once the -900 rolls out, keeping all of them in sync and smoothing out some âannoyancesâ, fixing bugs, and improving the airplane handling (as an example, they mention the elimination of the notchiness with nearly-centered ground steering).  Regarding the Electronic Flight Tablet, itâs still being worked on. They have figured out an alternate way around the C++/WASM limitation, using a much simpler script-based language that can âtalk to the outside worldâ, but PMDG found issues while trying to get the tablet and the airplane to communicate. While reinstating the lack of a release date for the EFT, they ensure itâs being extensively tested to provide the best experience possible once itâs out.Â   They finish off with a quick note on the modernized navdata implementation, which will replace their navdata system on the 737 once itâs ready to roll, allowing for greater accuracy in RNP procedures, and further improvements to the stability of lateral navigation. Thereâs no ETA for the said update.  The 900 is not available yet, but you can find the rest of the lineup on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Images are courtesy of Pineapple_Wizard.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Chicago Aurora Municipal Airport (KARR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a public airport serving the city of Aurora, in Illinois. Itâs sometimes used as a reliever airport for OâHare and Midway, due to its proximity to Chicago (80 kilometers west).Â   It houses the Air Classics Museum of Aviation, which includes a collection of aircraft, vehicles, uniforms, and other aviation memorabilia from the 30s to the current day. The aircraft collection includes a Republic P-47D Thunderbolt replica, a Bayerische Flugwerke Messerschmitt BF-109 replica, a North American Aviation RF-86F Sabre, a McDonnell Douglas TA-4J Skyhawk, a Republic Aviation F-105D Thunderchief, a North American T-39 Sabreliner, a McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom II, a Ling-Temco-Vought A-7E Corsair II, a Bell UH-1H Iroquois, a Curtiss P-40 WarHawk replica, and a North American Aviation P-51D Mustang Replica.  As a curious fact, the Aurora Municipal Airport is one of the few airports in the United States where the FAA and IATA identifiers are not the same, because ARR was taken on the IATA by an airport in Argentina. Thus, it uses AUZ as its IATA code.Â   The traffic figures sit at 76,650 aircraft operations between April 2021 and April 2022, averaging 210 per day, with 98% corresponding to general aviation, 2% to air taxi, and 1% to military and commercial, respectively.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it stands, with full-detail buildings, realistic ground markings, high-resolution ground imagery, custom night lighting, high-detail airport vehicles, full set of signs, fencing, vegetation, PBR materials, interior details and parallax internals, and optional static aircraft.  Itâs available onÂ UK2000âs StoreÂ andÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.65 and $14.15, respectively. At least 24 MB of free disk space is required to install the product.

    <title>Cowan Simulation Updates 500E for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cowan Simulation has recently issued the very first update to their rendition of the MD 500E, fixing issues with the flight model, adjusting the 3D model, and more.  The MD Helicopters MD 500E is part of a family of light utility civilian and military helicopters, introduced in 1967 with the Hughes 500 (which was a civilian version of the OH-6A Cayuse/Loach), and developed over time into what it is now after Hughes was acquired in the 1980s by McDonnell Douglas Helicopters.Â   The 500E variant is an executive version of the 500D with a recontoured nose, certified in 1982. Itâs powered by a Rolls-Royce Model 250-C20B turboshaft engine rated at 420 hp, with a maximum cruise speed of 135 knots and a range of 235 nautical miles at sea level, according to a 2022 chart.  The update brings many improvements to the flight model based on customer feedback. The developer mentions it still flies with a slight low left skid, and they plan to work more with the flight model in the future. The trim ball was also improved, yet they say it's not quite optimized for helicopters when using the correct code. Adjustments were made to the air intake tube in the nose, along with other small details in the 3d model. The remainder of the changelog follows down below:  The red emergency fuel cutoff valve code was fixed. There was a bug with wrong values. Now that should work properly. Pushed in is open and pulled out is closed. The ignition key needs to be on to run the starter now. Hopefully this does not trip anyone up.Â  The two cabin light switches and the lighting attached was changed. Now one is red and one is white and they are not so bright so you can use them at night. All the other lighting was gone through and optimized. Added some ambient light from the green panel lights. Fixed the skid nav lights with flex. Added some occluders to the skids and new bear paws so the grass lays/smashes down when off pavement. The two buttons above the cabin light toggles are now tied to rotor wash and engine heat blur effects. Pushing them will disable either respectively. 15 new liveries were added to the package to make a total of 63 available. Thank you Chrigel Linder for your contribution to this project. â â The 500E is available onÂ Cowan Simâs StoreÂ andÂ SimMarketÂ for $32.99 and roughly $33.33, respectively.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Spinoza has recently released their rendition of Interlaken Airport (LSMI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a former military airbase dating back to WW2.  Built by the Swiss Army Military in 1940, it originally had two runways, with the first one made of concrete and 600m of total length, made operational in 1942. The second one, 900 meters long, was completed a year later. After the war, it was converted into a Jet Maintenance Base for the De Havilland Vampire, with an eventual runway expansion to accommodate the fighter (the original runway was extended to 920 meters), along with the construction of a control tower. Further lengthening happened in the following decades, where it ended up at 1656 meters.  Commercial service took place for the first time in 1964, with Globe-Air flying from Interlaken to London thrice a week until 1967.  The base was closed in 2003, now hosting REGA 10, a Swiss Air-Rescue service responsible for more than 1100 mountain rescue operations annually.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the former airport as it stands, with the military hangars, a 3D model of the Jungfrau Park, and the REGA 10 - Wilderswil base.  Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $14.11, requiring at least 223 MB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, developer Just Flight has announced its latest project for MSFS - the Avro Vulcan. The team is working hard to bring this iconic British bomber to the community, utilizing the latest technologies the simulator has to offer. Just Flight has previously released a version of the bomber for X-Plane, P3D, and FSX, and is currently working to improve the plane and âbring it up to the very latest MSFS standardsâ. At this stage, however, it is unclear how much of the plane will be inherited from these older versions and how much of it will be built from the ground up. Alongside the announcement, a few preview photos of the plane have also been released to showcase its detailed modeling and texturing. According to the developers, the Vulcanâs basic flight model and systems are already complete and the plane is just entering an early testing phase. Though the team is quite optimistic about the bomberâs development, they stressed that their main focus is currently directed at other projects such as the F28 and RJ series. Currently, there is little information on the release date or pricing of the product. However, the developers did hint that the aircraft will also come to Xbox, provided that Microsoft fixes âthe current WASM issuesâ. Threshold will keep you updated on the progress of the Vulcan. â</summary>

The island is named after his flagship, Maria Galanda. The Carib Indians called it âAichiâ and the Arawaks would refer to it as âToloukaera.â The Mills, one of the island's highlights, were built in 1664 when Madame de Boisseret handed over her rights to the Company of the West Indies, which built their first oxen-powered mills. By 1830, the island had a total of 105 mills. Nowadays, only 72 remain. The scenery features 4K PBR textures, accurate terraforming and runway slope, dynamic night lighting, and a true-to-life landside recreation. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $6.47, requiring at least 127 MB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently released their rendition of the Boeing 737-900 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, adding to the other - already released - three variants of their 737 lineup.Â   The 737-900 is the longest 737 variant to date, with 42.11m of total length, seating up to 189 people in a high-density layout, or 177 on two-class, whilst keeping the same MTOW and fuel capacity as of the -800. It was first flown in 2001 with Alaska Airlines. The 737-900ER, on the other hand, can seat up to 220 passengers with a single-class configuration or 180 with two classes, along with an increased range (as implied by the name), around 3,280nm (the normal -900 only has 2,800nm). Due to its limited carrying capacity and range, the -900 was unsuccessful, with only 52 orders in total. The ER variant has accumulated over 500 orders recently.  PMDGâs rendition features a fully customized system simulation for all major and minor aircraft system components, a highly sophisticated logical simulation of onboard information systems and aircraft management, a customized flight model with enhanced physics augmentation, rigid body physics for wing and tail surfaces, fully customized flight control systems, accurate resolution cockpit displays, interchangeable equipment options for cockpit instrumentation, numerous user-configurable options, native datalink simulation compatible with SimBrief, a driveable pushback tug, a custom sound package, a highly-detailed tridimensional cockpit, advanced animations, and a complete tutorial for 737 beginners.Â   The developer has also listed some features that are to come in future updates, including the custom EFB, high-resolution cabin models and gear bay interiors for the entire 737 lineup, and Asobo-dependant updates such as the weather radar, which they mention as an example.Â   The -900 ($49.99) and the rest of the lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>iniBuilds Announces Bf108 Taifun for Microsoft Flight Simulator</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently announced the second addition to their classic lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator: the Bf108 Taifun, a single-engine sport aircraft developed by Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in the early 1930s, with 885 units built in total. The Taifun was designed to compete in the 4th Challenge International de Tourisme, the fourth and last International Tourist Plane Contest held by the FAI (FÃ©dÃ©ration aÃ©ronautique internationale), taking place in Warsaw, Poland. It was a major aviation event in pre-war Europe, held from 1929 to 1934. The prototype, then called M34, was powered by a 247 hp Hirth HM 8U V8 engine, did not win the competition, more so, was outperformed by many other aircraft, yet managed to impress with a low fuel consumption rate, good handling, and take-off/landing characteristics. The Bf108a variant took off for the first time in 1934, powered by three different engines: the original Hirth HM 8U, the Argus As 17B with 217 hp, and later units had a Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial, with 158hp. The Bf108b was a revised version whose prototype had a Siemens-Halske Sh 14a radial, but the production model sported an Argus As 10C instead, delivering 237 hp, or the Argus AS 10E with 266 hp.  iniBuildsâ rendition makes use of the latest CFD technology on all primary and control flight surfaces, as well as the propeller, and with specifically modeled unique characteristics of the real-life counterpart like the capability of landing as slow as 45 knots thanks to its leading edge slats. The inclusion of such details enables a realistic STOL performance.  With the help of Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs modern fuel system, the developers managed to model an authentic fuel system that closely matches the real-world behavior of the Argus As10 engine. The airplane features interactable elements that range from foldable wings to doors and storage compartments, and many EFB-controlled features such as customizable rain covers, language, units, curtain visibility, etc. On that language note, they mention it will come with two sets of gauges and panel text, with German or English texts, and either metric or imperial units.  The complete feature list follows down below: There is no information on the release date or price yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Taxi2gate has recently announced their first scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator: Pointe-Ã -Pitre International Airport (TFFR), serving the city of Pointe-Ã -Pitre on the island of Grand-Terre in Guadeloupe, boasting a yearly average of 2.4 million passengers, making it the second busiest airport in the Lesser Antilles region. It is the main airport of the French West Indies and a hub for Air CaraÃ¯bes, sporting a single terminal building with modern facilities and services, including shops, restaurants, lounges, and car rental. It offers direct flights to destinations across Europe, North America, and the Caribbean, connecting Guadeloupe to the rest of the world and playing a vital role in the region's tourism industry and economic development. Nothing has been revealed in terms of features but thereâs a chance it could be similar to their Prepar3d v5 version (released in mid-2022), which features custom ground textures, custom photoscenery, carefully detailed 3d objects, realistic ground markings, night lighting, PBR textures, and a 3D terminal interior. They have also claimed to be working on Orlando (KMCO) and Paris Charles de Gaulle (LFPG), to come later. Pointe-Ã -Pitre, on the other hand, is said to be coming soon. Thereâs no information on the release date or price yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>
