    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has recently teased the progress on the upcoming update for their Porto Alegre Salgado Filho International Airport (SBPA) scenery, serving the city of Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It is the ninth busiest airport in the country, with nearly 8 million passengers yearly (pre-pandemic).  Originally called SÃ£o JoÃ£o Federal Airport, it was just an air club, with its first flights dating back to 1923. It saw commercial action for the first time in 1932, when VARIG (the oldest Brazilian airline) replaced their seaplanes with land airplanes, adopting Porto Alegre as their hub. It took eight years for the commission of an actual passenger terminal. Its current name was adopted in 1952, after Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, a local politician who had died a year prior (air crash).  Itâs a focus city for Azul Brazilian Airlines, with a significant domestic network (fifteen destinations) and international legs to Punta del Este and Montevideo (Uruguay). The other two Brazilian giants, GOL Linhas AÃ©reas (thirteen domestic destinations) and LATAM Brasil (5 domestic destinations), are also regularly seen around POA. TAP Air Portugal is the sole European visitor, coming from Lisbon.  Not much was said other than the pictures themselves and the fact itâs still undergoing development.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, developer ToLiss announced the A320 NEO as their next product for X-Plane. The aircraft will mark yet another addition to the already impressive ToLiss Airbus fleet that includes the A319, A321, and A340. â From the teaser picture that accompanied the announcement, it can be seen that the exterior modeling of the aircraft has already been completed, including the brand new engines that distinguishes the NEO from the other A320 variants.  ToLiss has only released limited information regarding the NEO. Therefore, it is unclear whether the A320 NEO will receive a cockpit completely modeled from the ground up or one thatâs derived from that of the A321 and A319. It is also not known if Toliseâs NEO will feature both the CFM Leap and the PW1000G engine options. â Currently, a firm release date is yet to be disclosed but the A320 is expected to come out sometime in March of this year. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The flight simulation community has seen the emergence of a new developer group, CreatorOfWorldS (COWS). The team has generated significant interest with their first product in production, the Diamond DA42 aircraft, a highly detailed and accurate replica of the aircraft. Early previews of the product have generated excitement among enthusiasts and professionals alike when shared on social media. Their first public appearance was under another name. We covered the quartet of developers "Simmy Aircraft" for their first debut in an earlier article. COWS has stated that their primary goal is to provide products that will aid in training and simulation opportunities for students and consumers. They have put a lot of effort into replicating the flight behaviour and systems through real aircraft testing and feedback. The development team comprises four members, one of which is Mitchell, who is in charge of creating the meticulously crafted 3D model of the plane. He had direct access to a DA42 throughout the development process, which means that everything about the model has been created based on manuals, pictures, first-hand experience, and a lot of passion for the project. Another team member, Jacob, is responsible for everything under the hood. He has carefully recreated the flight model, electrics, fuel, engine control units, and de-ice system based on the aircraft's manuals and first-hand experience flying the real-life counterparts. The flight model has been tuned to match performance tables accurately, and the result is so close to the real plane that it can be handled just as it would in the real world. Boris is in charge of creating the sounds for the aircraft. He is known for his work in the flight simulation community, being in charge of audio at FlyByWire, the FlightFX Vision Jet and having created sound packs for the Cirrus SR-22 in Microsoft Flight Simulator. To create realistic sounds for the COWS' DA42, Boris has recorded real aircraft sounds and incorporated them into the simulator to ensure a truly immersive user experience. With Peter at the helms of reason, administrative tasks, branding and 3D work assistance, the four members sum up the current team. The COWS DA42 is equipped with a fully custom Garmin G1000NXi avionics system. This system has been created using a combination of manuals, first-hand experience, and Garmin software in order to make it as accurate as possible to the real-world version of the system. The system includes simulation of many of the features of the real Garmin, such as the GPS satellite constellation, profile saving and copying, persistent settings, and system statuses. The system also includes simulations of other systems, such as the PFD, AHRS, ADC, GTX335R, and GMU. Currently, the only features that remain to be added to the simulation are custom flight planning with custom LNAV/VNAV and maps. The system also has the capability to remember user settings. It allows for per-livery, and per-aircraft configurations, giving users the ability to customise their avionics package to their preferences.  The video is a demonstration of the fully custom G1000NXi from COWS own press release. â â The development is still ongoing, and the team is working hard to bring the DA42s to the flight simulation community. No timeline is given, but they are dedicated to ensuring no stone is left unturned and bringing the best DA42s they can offer their users. However, as the team put it, it will take them a little more time to finish everything and ensure everything is perfect. In their press release, COWS mention that their next project will be the DA40-180 XLS, after their DA42 series.  To follow their progress, you can join their discord.  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published theÂ first development updateÂ on the Fokker 70 &amp; Â 100 project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, announced last year. Itâs composed of some information on the current state of things and fourteen screenshots.Â   Their Fokker 100âs cockpit, exterior models, and textures are undergoing extensive testing, with dynamic lighting in the cockpit and externally being the latest addition. Work is yet to begin on the 70 variant and a detailed passenger cabin for both. Just Flight plans to keep everyone updated with further development updates.Â   The product will feature (once finished) native models with 4K and 8K textures, realistic animations including dynamic wing-flex, all doors (including cargo), lift-dumpers, and the tail-mounted airbrake. The cockpit will feature hundreds of functional switches, knobs, controls, and high-resolution displays, driven by complex custom-coded systems based on real-world FCOMs, including hydraulic, electrical, fuel, pressurization, and a custom navigation system with an FMS.Â   The Fokker 70 &amp; 100 are twin-turbofan regional aircraft, developed by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker. The Fokker 70 is a shorter version of the 100, seating up to 86 passengers. The F100 variant can fit up to 110 passengers. They were introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, rapidly gaining popularity among regional airlines due to their cost-effectiveness and reliability. However, due to financial difficulties, Fokker went bankrupt in 1996, with a permanent halting of the production line. Despite it all, there are many F70s and F100s around to this day, especially in Australia.  Thereâs no information regarding the price or release date yet.

Itâs the only commercial airline that operates in Egilsstadir as of 2022.  Built in the 1940s as a USAF base, it was repurposed into a civilian airport after the war, with several expansions in the following decades to accommodate larger aircraft and higher passenger numbers. Today, itâs a hub for regional air travel and a popular tourist destination in the eastern part of Iceland. Itâs used as a diversion airport for flights originally headed to Keflavik, the busiest airport in Iceland.  The scenery features an accurate replica of the terminal, with custom hangars and buildings, typical Icelandic houses, the Fellabaer Bridge, realistic markings on the runway, apron and taxiways, custom objects and environment details, and high-detail textures with PBR.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.80, requiring at least 221 MB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
