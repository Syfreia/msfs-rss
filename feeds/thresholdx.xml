    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Microsoft Flight Simulator team has recently released their fourteenth local legend: the Bell 47J Ranger, the first helicopter to carry a United States president. Introduced in 1956, the 47J Ranger is the executive variant of the Bell 47, which was the first helicopter certified for civilian use and one of the most popular helicopters to exist, with 5,600 built. While the Bell 47 could only seat two people, the 47J could seat four. â Two units were purchased by the American government in 1957 to transport the president, Dwight Eisenhower, to and from the White House. They were eventually removed from presidential duties in 1962 but still handled VIP transports until they were fully retired in 1967. â Three hundred sixty-one units were manufactured over its production period, handling VIP transport, cargo, air ambulance, commuter flights, aerial surveying, and military applications. It was also featured in many popular movies, such as James Bondâs Thunderball from 1965. â Powered by a 260 hp Lycoming VO-540-B1B piston engine, it can cruise at 91 mph, with a service ceiling of 11,000 ft and a range of 260 miles.  â Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs rendition features two landing gear types, with seven liveries per variant. â Itâs available in the Marketplace for $14.99.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Ontario International Airport (KONT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of San Bernardino, Riverside, and Greater Los Angeles with a yearly average of 5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1941 as an Army Air Corps aircraft training and operation base. After the war, it became a large storage, sale, and scrapping center for Army Air Forces aircraft.Â  â Shortly after, in 1946, the airport was renamed from âOntario Municipal Airportâ to âOntario International Airportâ because of outgoing trans-Pacific cargo flights. The first international passenger flight happened that same year, a Pacific Overseas Airlines flight from Shanghai to Ontario, inaugurating round-trip air passenger service between the United States and the Orient. Western Airlines began operating at the airport three years later, followed by Bonanza Air Lines in 1955. â A new terminal was opened in 1998, discontinuing the old terminals, which now function as the administration and the USO. There are 26 gates total, with 12 on T2 and 14 on T4. Terminal 2 hosts Alaska Airlines, Avianca El Salvador, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines, and Volaris. Terminal 4 hosts American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest. â Itâs a FedEx and UPS Airlines cargo hub, transporting cargo all over North America and Asia (UPS). Amazon Air, Ameriflight, Amerijet International, Asia Pacific Airlines, and Kalitta Air also serve it. Ontario International is the ninth-largest cargo airport in the United States. â â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with over 60 highly detailed building models with PBR texturing, custom ground poly, custom animated jetways with gate numbering, improved taxiway and runway lighting, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.26, requiring at least 714.80 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. In a lengthy announcement in their Discord and on the iniBuilds forum, Synaptic Simulations has announced that they will be moving away from having their rendition of the Airbus A220 for free, to a payware model, with support from iniBuilds, and they will be adding Xbox support as well. â In their post, they elaborate on some of the reasons why they moved away from a freeware to a payware product: âThis decision comes out of a realization of the project's potential as well as the ever-growing development demands during often busy and stressful times for our team.â Also in the announcement were more details concerning what will come with the Synaptic A220 on release, which will feature both the -300 and -100 variants, as well as an ACJ220 variant coming in âlater as a free upgrade to customers of the base package.â  Synaptic also addresses concerns about this change, saying âWe understand any unfavorable feelings you may have toward this decision, as it was a tough one for us to make knowing the support you have all given us with the promise of a free and open-source add-on. We hope that you will remain committed to this project, as our commitment to deliver the best A220 experience remains steady.â The Synaptic team say that they will publish an FAQ in the âvery near future,â and that they encourage the community to ask questions in the meantime. â Although nothing about a release window or pricing has been announced yet, Threshold will keep you informed once we know, so stay tuned for that, and for more high quality flight simulation news, reviews, and more!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flight Simulation Design Group has just released their newest foray into the flight simulation scenery space, recreating the island and airport of Kefalonia, Greece, in Microsoft Flight Simulator. Kefalonia is the first in a series of products that FSDG is calling the âScenic Routes Edition.â Kefalonia, or Cephalonia, is the largest of the Ionian islands in the Adriatic Sea off of the west coast of Greece. It is a popular destination for many European tourists during the summer for its fair weather. Kefaloniaâs Airport is served by many low-cost carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair, and TUI, but almost all of its air traffic is seasonal, with only one route to Athens served by Aegean Airways being operated year-round.  FSDGâs rendition of Kefalonia features not only the airport but many landmarks around the island and buildings such as hotels. The airport itself features high-quality texturing and modeling, as well as 3D interiors, and custom night lighting. You can get Kefalonia for â¬15.69 on SimMarket, and it will take up approximately 3.98GB of disk space.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. In their most recent developer livestream hosted on Wednesday, Microsoft and Asobo showed off more features for the upcoming Sim Update 15, an overhaul to the default G3X by Working Title, a few more bits on the highly anticipated MSFS 2024, and much more! â Starting off with Sim Update 15, the newest update to the simulator is slated to land on March 12th, with a public beta starting soon. The main focus for this update is improving performance, and especially with memory usage improvements. Working with Working Title Simulations, Microsoft and Asobo have been able to squeeze more performance out of the glass cockpits by reworking the CoherentGT thread, which is the process that renders glass cockpits, and is a common pitfall when it comes to performance with complex glass cockpit aircraft.  As for memory allocation, the Asobo team was able to backport the technology from the upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the most benefit will come to those low in RAM, or have a stutter-filled experience. A new system for handling AI and ATC interaction with airports will also be coming in the update as well, and fixes to the many bugs and quirks that the system has gotten a reputation for. In addition, many highly requested fixes that concern snow coverage, with the sim incorrectly freezing over lakes being one of the many fixes.  Also, Jorg Neumann, Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator has confirmed that Microsoft Flight Simulator will be expanding support for Xbox Cloud Gaming in SU15, adding support for mobile devices and touchscreens. Finally, dual-rotor support has been added, allowing developers to finally be able to correct popular helicopters such as the Chinook, and the V22 Osprey. Another thing revealed during this monthâs dev livestream was the reworked Garmin G3X Touch built by Working Title Simulations. It will feature all the goodies we can expect from a Working Title rework, including a faithful recreation of the styling, layout, and symbology of the real G3X unit, as well as having a functioning EIS page, and specific configurations for different aircraft types. When it releases, the new G3X Touch will come installed in the default XCub, NXCub, and VL-3.  Moving on to the iniBuilds A320neo, which is currently still in the development phase, after coming under stability issues during the Sim Update 14 Beta, as well as speculation that it violated the GPL. Jorg Neumann addressed the question of the release date saying, âIâm not 100% sure itâs going to make SU15â¦itâs tightâ¦[it] wonât be in the first beta for sure.â There was a lot in this monthâs dev stream, so here are some of the other points that didnât make it into the larger categories: â You can watch the whole one and a half hour stream on their Twitch channel. â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more high-quality flight simulation news and reviews!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Leeds Bradford Airport (EGNM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving North and West Yorkshire with a yearly average of 3.3 million passengers.  It was opened in 1931 as Leeds and Bradford Municipal Aerodrome (or Yeadon Aerodrome), mostly used for general aviation and training during its initial years, with scheduled flights starting in 1935.  Work on the main terminal started around the late 30s but only reached full completion after WW2.Â   Avro constructed a shadow factory during that WW2 period called the Leeds Bradford Airport Depot, with over 5,000 aircraft before its closure in December 1946.  In the early 1980s, the runway was extended, allowing it to be classified as a regional airport. After the extension, Wardair commenced international flights to Toronto in a 747 in 1984.  The airport underwent expansion work in the late 90s and early 2000s, allowing it to reach an 88% increase in passenger traffic by 2007 (2.9 million passengers visited the airport that year).  The highest airport in the United Kingdom (681ft!) is an operating base for Jet2.com and Ryanair and is served by Aer Lingus, Aurigny, easyJet, KLM, and WizzAir.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, highly detailed models, an up-to-date layout, custom jetways, PBR texturing, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $12.73, requiring at least 3.65 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. In an unexpected move during this weekendâs X-Plane Developer Summit in MontrÃ©al, Canada, developers ToLiss Simulations and FlightFactor have announced that they are collaborating on developing a rendition of the Airbus A350 for the X-Plane 12 platform.  FlightFactor and ToLiss, are both known well for their simulations of Airbus aircraft. ToLiss has been exclusively developing Airbus aircraft for X-Plane, while FlightFactor have developed both Boeing and Airbus, with their 2nd rendition of the Boeing 777 on the way. FlightFactor released their version of an A350 back during the days of X-Plane 10. Both companies are usually in competition with each other for the Airbus market, but now they have come together to create what will certainly be a very high quality, if not the best rendition of Airbusâ newest airliner for the X-Plane platform to date.  No other information about how this partnership will work, or anything other than just a simple confirmation that joint development is going on has been released yet, but Threshold will keep you informed, so stay tuned for that, and for more high-quality flight simulation news and editorials! </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. David Rosenfeld has recently previewed his rendition of Milan Malpensa Airport (LIMC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Milan metropolitan area with a yearly average of 26.1 million passengers.  â The site where the airport was built has more than a century of aviation history, with records dating back to 1910 when the Caproni brothers flew their Cal biplane. It became a popular prototype testing site in Italy, eventually leading to its upgrade to an actual airfield.Â  â During that same period, the Caproni brothers decided to build a factory there, and Giovanni Augusta followed suit. It became the largest aircraft production center in the country.  â In the following decades, the airfield hosted two Royal Italian Air Force squadrons.Â  â In September 1943, the German Luftwaffe captured the airfield, building its first concrete runway, which didnât last long: the airfield was heavily bombed during WW2.Â   â With the retreat of the German forces from Italy and the eventual end of the war, the runway was rebuilt and extended to 1,800 meters. A small terminal was built to shelter passengers and cargo from adverse weather conditions. â Its official inauguration happened in 1948 asÂ Aeroporto CittÃ  di Busto Arsizio, with Sabena and TWA being one of the first international carriers to serve it.  â In 1952, now under the control of the municipality of Milan, it was decided that Malpensa would become Milanâs international airport, and Linate (Milanâs other airport) would handle domestic services.Â   â As Milanâs main airport, it needed a respectable terminal, which was built between 1958 and 1962. The runways were also extended and were the longest in Europe then.Â   â Even though their original intent was to make Linate domestic-only, major European carriers preferred it over Malpensa because it was closer to the city center, transforming it into a secondary airport for over 20 years.Â  â Things were only to change in the 1980s when Linate was forcibly downgraded to domestic, and Malpensa underwent heavy upgrade work. Construction started in 1990, and it only reopened eight years later. â â Itâs an operating base for AlbaStar, easyJet Europe, Malta Air, Neos, Ryanair, and Wizz Air. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air France, Air India, AirBaltic, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Etihad Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, and Vueling also serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom jetways, custom ground textures, and more. â Thereâs no release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released an emergency update for their Airbus A300-600R for Microsoft Flight Simulator, addressing an LNAV issue introduced in the previous update from a few days ago.  Given its âhotfix-ishâ nature, the fifth updateâs changelog is relatively small, with only four changes:Â  â â The add-on is available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $45, requiring at least 8 GB of free hard disk space to install.
