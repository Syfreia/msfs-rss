    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Dreamfoil Creations who are fresh off of the release of their Schweitzer S300CBi have provided an update regarding the development of their upcoming Bell 407 for X-Plane 12.Â  â The Bell 407Â  is an iconic helicopter that was first introduced in 1996. The Bell 407 was developed from the older Bell 206L LongRanger, featuring a 4-bladed rotor, a sleeker rotor housing, and larger windows. The 407 is equipped with an Allison 250-C47B turboshaft engine providing over 800 shaft horsepower. With seating for 5 and a maximum takeoff weight of 6000 lbs, the 407 is capable of flying 324 nm with a cruise speed of 133 knots. â In the update posted to their Facebook page, which featured a single picture, Dreamfoil stated that the external texturing work for the new 407 is about 85% complete. The update also includes information about a poll taken on their forums that showed a majority of users would prefer an analogue cockpit over a glass panel based on the X-Plane Garmin G1000. The update also suggested that the 407 will come with options for both a Garmin 430/530 GPS set-up as well as an option to use the G1000h based on X-Planeâs G1000. At this time there's no information regarding price or a potential release date, however, it seems that the helicopter is coming together quite well. â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold, your home for everything flight simulation!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Microsoft has released their latest Sim Update for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing with it many bug fixes, changes, and new features to the simulator. â The major new features in this update include new Assistance features with their new Flight Plan Assistance setting, as well as fixes to the Air Traffic Control systems, improving instruction logic and phraseology. Sim Update 14 also adds a new aircraft, the Cirrus SR22 G6, complete with avionics made in partnership with Working Title. However, this upgraded Cirrus is only available to customers who have purchased the Premium Deluxe upgrade for the sim.  â Another significant change is the removal of the iniBuilds A320neo from the update. Initially promised to be slated for this update by Jorg Neumann, Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator in their September Dev Livestream, and included in the SU14 Beta, it is now absent. According to the Sim Update 14 patch notes, Microsoft explains that the reason behind the delay was that during testing they âencountered an application crash rate on console that is too high to pass certification.â Recently, the iniBuilds A320neo has come under fire from accusations that it stole code from the popular open-source A320neo made by FlyByWire, thus allegedly violating the General Public License. This change has left some users speculating whether the accusations of stolen code were the actual reason behind the delay.  â Also included in Sim Update 14 are the changes to the atmosphere and lighting in the sim, as mentioned in Microsoftâs November Dev Livestream. These highly requested changes fix sky colors and make the atmosphere and horizon look more realistic. There have also been fixes to the snow coverage and icing systems and other changes to live weather. As with all of the Sim Updates, there are a whole host of small tweaks and squashed bugs that are too many to list here, but you can find the full patch notes on Microsoftâs website here. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Secret Studio has recently released their rendition of Sultan Mahmud Kuala Terengganu International Airport (WMKN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Kuala Terengganu in Malaysia with a yearly average of 919,829 passengers. â It was established in the 1920s as a small airfield, used primarily for military purposes during World War II. It served as a base for the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Japanese Imperial Army.â  After the war, the British colonial authorities expanded and upgraded the airport to accommodate civilian air travel. It was renamed Sultan Mahmud Airport in honor of Sultan Mahmud Al-Muktafi Billah Shah, the 16th Sultan of Terengganu.  In the following years, Sultan Mahmud Airport became an important transportation hub for the Terengganu region, connecting it with other parts of Malaysia and neighboring countries. The airport underwent several upgrades and modernizations to keep pace with the region's air travel growth.  In 2008, a major renovation and expansion project was undertaken to upgrade the airport's facilities and increase its capacity. The project included constructing a new terminal building, a new runway, and other airport infrastructure improvements.  Today, Sultan Mahmud Airport is one of the busiest airports in Malaysia, serving as a vital economic driver for the Terengganu region, supporting tourism, trade, and other industries. The airport continues to evolve and expand to meet the growing demand for air travel in Malaysia and the surrounding regions.  It's served by four airlines: AirAsia (Kuala Lumpur-International), Batik Air Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur-Subang), Firefly (Kuala Lumpur-Subang), and Malaysia Airlines (Kuala Lumpur-International).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality custom buildings, PBR textures, an in-house VDGS system, custom ILS, custom animated jetways, custom terraforming, a detailed terminal interior, and custom ground traffic.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.97 and requires at least 888.37 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimWorks Studios has recently released their rendition of the Pilatus PC-12 Legacy for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a single-engined turboprop aircraft first flown in the early 1990s and popular among corporate transport companies, government agencies, and air-ambulance operators.  Its development was announced in October 1989 at the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), and it had been under development for a few years prior under high levels of secrecy (they had commenced the prototype assembly by the time it was announced). It was believed to be the first single-engined aircraft capable of flying at high speed across long distances, a market that was unheard of back then. The prototype was completed in May 1991, and the first flight took off only 30 days later.Â   While the original plans were for a mid-1991 certification, a wing redesign delayed progress by a few years, with the certification only being issued in March 1994 (Europe) and July 1994 (United States).  It has undergone multiple improvements over its production span, with more powerful engines, new avionics, noise reduction measures, new propellers, increased speed and range, and more. It was also modified by other aviation firms that added their enhancement packages.  The variant at hand was certified in 2005, and it's powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-67B engine, with a range of 1742 miles, a maximum take-off weight of 4,740 kg, and a cruise speed of 500 km/h.Â   The add-on features an accurate simulation of the PC-12, developed with help from Pilatus Aircraft and Fly7 Executive Aviation, replicating the real aircraft's handling behavior with correct propeller beta and reverse operation, custom ITT simulation, and realistic flap deployment timings. It also includes various custom systems, ranging from a custom aileron-rudder interconnect system to usable circuit breakers, PMS GTN, TDS GTNXi, and Sky4Sim Tablet compatibility. The complete list of features follows below:   It's available onÂ their storeÂ andÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $26.98, requiring at least 3.95 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly X Simulations has recently released their rendition of Kuusamo Airport (EFKS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the northeastern part of the Northern Ostrobothnia in Finland with a yearly average of 87,000 passengers.  It was inaugurated in 1972, with a regular scheduled route between Oulu and Kuusamo starting that same year. The original runway length was around 800 meters, which was expanded for the first time in 1974 to 1,500 meters so that larger aircraft could visit it.   In the late 1980s, the passenger terminal was inaugurated, and the runway was extended to 2,000 meters so they could get jet traffic.  The late 1990s brought the final runway extension (to 2,500 meters), and the passenger terminal was expanded for the first time.Â   In the early 2000s, the airport was granted its international status and underwent a renovation and expansion of its terminal building.  Itâs served by Finnair with a daily route to Helsinki and visited by Lufthansa, Jet2, TUI Airways, and TUI fly Netherlands on a seasonal basis.\  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings (including wear and tear), high-resolution PBR textures, accurate airport buildings, and a detailed airside terminal interior.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $11.32, requiring at least 409 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

In the early 1980s, the runway was extended, allowing it to be classified as a regional airport. After the extension, Wardair commenced international flights to Toronto in a 747 in 1984.  The airport underwent expansion work in the late 90s and early 2000s, allowing it to reach an 88% increase in passenger traffic by 2007 (2.9 million passengers visited the airport that year).  The highest airport in the United Kingdom (681ft!) is an operating base for Jet2.com and Ryanair and is served by Aer Lingus, Aurigny, easyJet, KLM, and WizzAir.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date 2023 airport layout, fully-reworked PBR ground poly, custom lighting, LOD optimization to ensure best performance, animated custom jetways, a high-detail ATC tower with animated air traffic controllers, detailed walkway interior, hand-placed animated horses, a detailed spotting area west of runway 14, updated signage, and more.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $17.85 (V1 owners are eligible for a discounted upgrade fee), requiring at least 6.01 GB of free hard disk space to install.

VSkylabs, well-known for its focus on unique and iconic aircraft, recently released the Hungarocopter as well. VSkylabs is dedicated to numerous details and features specific to the SR-71, spanning systems, animations, and mission configurations. The flight model is currently at v1.0 (Early Access), with ongoing improvements planned for future releases. Notable flight model features include correct algorithms controlling Air Inlet spikes, ramjet characteristics, and propulsion simulation. Accurate throttle setting regimes enable conventional operations, where fully aft results in cutoff. The Chemical Ignition System is simulated, complete with visual startup effects. Furthermore, afterburner variable exhaust nozzles are simulated and animated. The Blackbird's unique air inlet system, including the inlet spike movements and settings, aft bypass doors, fuel systems, Â electrical systems, and hydraulics, are also faithfully simulated. Flight control surfaces are animated to authentic real-life parameters. Air-to-air refueling sequences are simulated as well. The 3D model has been meticulously reconstructed from their older model to incorporate as many details into the sim as possible. The infamous A330 Start Cart is modeled and animated, featuring FMOD sounds of the Buick Wildcat V8 401 ci engines. Lockheed's D-21 reconnaissance drone is also modeled. The fully detailed VR-compatible cockpit replicates all the details of the actual aircraft.  See a complete and extensive list of features via the product page. Check out the free flight manual here. VSkylabs aims to build the most accurate SR-71 for any simulator, and so far, they have delivered. The SR-71 Blackbird is available for purchase via VSkylabs website or X-Plane.org for $37.00 â As always stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates! </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Santa Maria Airport (SBSM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Santa Maria in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.  It was opened in 1945 on an urgent basis with the help of the United States Army, featuring a runway that was for many years the longest in the state, only behind Porto Alegre Airport after its expansion from 2280 meters to 3200, making it 500 meters longer than Santa Mariaâs main runway.Â   An air base was inaugurated in 1971, sharing the facilities with the civil part. The agreement continued until 2015 when the full ownership was transferred to the Municipality of Santa Maria.  Itâs currently served by Azul Linhas AÃ©reas, who has a daily flight to Porto Alegre and a single seasonal route to FlorianÃ³polis.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed buildings, realistic ground markings, PBR materials, custom vegetation, custom night lighting, and custom interiors for the tower and passenger terminal.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.92 and requires at least 22.43 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSLTL, the developer behind the widely-used A.I. FSLTL Traffic for MSFS, has recently released an updated Base Model package featuring many enhancements. FSLTL seamlessly integrates aircraft into Microsoft Flight Simulator, providing users with a realistic, real-time experience of airline and general aviation traffic within the simulation environment. This software works seamlessly with MSFS default ATC and is VATSIM compatible through the provided VMR file. The latest update introduces an addition of 62 new liveries, comprising 38 for the 787-8, 16 for the ATR 42-500, and 8 for the ATR 42-600. This brings the total livery count to an extensive 1900! Additionally, the update addresses model issues, fixing broken animations like flaps and reversers. Other enhancements include the incorporation of "drooping elevator animations" for parked aircraft. An all-around overhaul of aircraft sounds has been implemented, ensuring a significant improvement across all models. Start-up and shutdown sounds have been completely revamped, with specific enhancements catering to V.R. and headphone users. In addition, the effects have been refined for optimal performance on all model LODs, featuring optimized heat blur effects contributing to an improvement in FPS performance. The lighting system has undergone a substantial rework, introducing new options that include faux flare and no flare lighting. The default is set to no flare, with adjusted flash rates on aircraft strobes, nav lights, and beacon lights to better align with real-world standards. Taxi and landing lights are now fixed to the front gear, extinguishing upon retraction. Some parked aircraft now feature logo lights, different colors for interior lighting, and smaller lights for aircraft positioned farther away from the user. Wingspan values have been adjusted to approximately 10 percent below real-life values to accommodate the additional 6m of space added to MSFS parking stands. The final version 1.3.1 includes minor fixes, with the VMR file receiving a complete update and the correction of the ICAO code for Porter Airlines DH8D to PTR. For users seeking to update or download FSLTL Traffic, the FlyByWire Installer provides a convenient installation process.
