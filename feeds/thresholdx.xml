    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Borneo Wonder Sceneries has recently released their rendition of Sandakan Airport (WBKS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Sandakan, the capital of the Sandakan District in Sabah, Malaysia.Â   Sandakan Airportâs history dates back to World War 2 when the Royal Air Force picked the site to build an airfield but didnât actually get to do much other than get rid of the vegetation before the Japanese invasion of Borneo. The Japanese Army, on the other hand, needed a refueling stop between the peninsular Malaya and the Philippines, transferring over 1,500 prisoners of war from the UK and Australia to work on the construction. Work started in August 1942 and saw partial completion by December of that same year, when a bomber aircraft landed in Sandakan for the first time, opening it for service.Â   The runway was recently extended to 2,500m, with an expansion plan that goes all the way back to 2017, with operations commencing in 2019 but delayed due to the pandemic and finally reaching completion in 2022, allowing the operation of popular narrowbody aircraft like the B737, A320, and the A321. Widebody aircraft can also operate on it with payload/range restrictions.Â   Itâs served by AirAsia (Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur), Malaysia Airlines (Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur), and MASwings (Kudat, Lahad Datu, Tawau), averaging around 900,000 passengers yearly.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a fully modeled terminal (including interior), landside buildings, custom ground textures, custom ground markings, and a custom jetway model.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $11.63, requiring at least 899 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlightFactor's A320 has been one of the most popular and well-regarded flight simulation aircraft for some time. The latest update to the A320 includes several improvements and fixes that enhance the overall experience of flying the plane. In this news article, we will take a closer look at the improvements and fixes introduced in the update. Cabin Visual Improvements: One of the most notable improvements in this update is the enhancement of the cabin visuals. The update brings improvements to the cabin, which helps to create a more immersive experience. These improvements make the cabin feel more realistic and add to the overall realism of the aircraft. Fixes: The update also includes several fixes which address issues that were present in previous versions of the addon. Some of these fixes are: â Dimmed Cabin Floor Light Stripe: One of the issues addressed in this update is the floor light stripe. The update fixes this issue and ensures that the light stripe appears as intended. â VSW Stuck and Not Moving: Another issue addressed in this update is the VSW stuck and not moving. The VSW (Vertical Speed Wheel) is an essential component of the aircraft, and when it gets stuck, it can cause problems for the pilot. The update fixes this issue and ensures that the VSW operates correctly. â Overspeed Protection Too Aggressive: The overspeed protection in the A320 was too aggressive, which meant that the aircraft would automatically reduce its speed even when it was not necessary. This update fixes this issue and ensures that the overspeed protection operates as intended. â Missed Doors in XP11 Version: In the XP11 version of the A320, some doors were missing. The update fixes this issue and ensures that all doors are present and functioning correctly. â Missed Internal Lights in the Cockpit and Cabin in XP11 Version: Another issue in the XP11 version was the missed internal lights in the cockpit and cabin. The update fixes this issue and ensures that all internal lights are present and working correctly. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The flight sim world is abuzz with excitement following the release of the AN225 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The AN225 Mriya, which means "Dream" in Ukrainian, is the world's largest aircraft and has a fascinating history. The INI Builds team along with Microsoft Flight sim has meticulously recreated this sorely missed behemoth of the skies in stunning detail, giving players the chance to experience what it's like to fly this iconic aircraft. The AN225 was originally designed in the Soviet Union in the 1980s as a heavy-lift transport aircraft for military and civilian use. The AN225 was used to transport the Soviet space shuttle, Buran, and was still used up until last year for heavy cargo transport, it was unfortunately destroyed in the ongoing Ukraine war. INI Builds has captured the essence of this aircraft in their simulation, from its massive wingspan to the distinctive six engines that power it. Pilots who purchase the MSFS/ INI Builds AN225 can experience the unique challenges of handling such a large and powerful machine. With great flight physics and attention to detail, the AN225 is sure to become a favourite among flight simulator pilots. MSFS have stated that 100% of the funds received from pilots who purchase the AN225 will go toward the cost of rebuilding the real aircraft.Â  You can pick up the AN225 on the MSFS store for just $19.99Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently announced the development of a Bern Airport (LSZB) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a regional aerodrome serving the capital of Switzerland, averaging a little under 200,000 passengers a year. It was established in 1929 by Alpar Bern Flugplatzgenossenschaft, which operated many routes out of the airfield until the war, making a brief return afterward but eventually ceasing operations in 1947 and being bought out by Swissair.  With a 1,720-meter-long paved runway dating back to 1950 (and a 650-meter-long grass runway), it's long enough for most private jets and regional airliners (and a proper glider playground).  Itâs served by four airlines: Helvetic Airways (Antalya, Heraklion, Kos, Larnaca, Palma de Mallorca, and Rhodes), LÃ¼beck Air (LÃ¼beck), Â SkyAlps (Olbia, seasonally), and Swiss Flight Services (Elba, also on a seasonal basis). The scenery is developed by an independent developer, Massimiliano Addante, an ex-FSDT scenarist, and it features an accurate representation of the airport with custom ortho and projected mesh, static helicopters and GA aircraft, and crisp 4K &amp; 2K PBR textures. â Orbx claims itâs releasing soon, with no exact date or pricing mentioned.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. AeroDesigns has recently announced their first product for Microsoft Flight Simulator: Portland International Jetport (KPWM), serving the city of Portland in Maine with a yearly average of 2 million passengers, making it the busiest in the state. The airportâs history dates back to the late 1920s when Dr. Clifford Strange needed somewhere to land his JN-4 âJennyâ Biplane. The first commercial service happened a few years later, in 1931, with a Boston-Maine Airways flight from Portland to Boston. The airfield was later purchased by the city and renamed to Portland-Westbrook Municipal Airport, which explains its origin code (PWM).  Nowadays, Portland benefits from low-cost carrier traffic such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which helped to rank the airport among the most affordable in the region as of 2011.  Originally intended to be just a port of their KPWM for X-Plane 11, the sceneryâs assets were entirely reworked, including ground textures, ground markings, taxi layout, a complete retexturing of the terminal building (externally and internally) with extra clutter to provide even better immersion. It also includes extra work on details such as dirt, extra ground service equipment, etc. AeroDesigns claims thereâs no release date as of yet, but they hope to release it in the next few weeks, with work still going on regarding performance optimization and overall refinement. Console compatibility is still unconfirmed. Stay tuned to Threshold for more information on the scenery and all things flight simulation! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, Bear Studios released their rendition of the MiG-15bis fighter for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing to the community an unique Cold War era Soviet fighter outfitted with detailed models and animations. According to the developers, the plane is created using real flight manuals of the MiG-15B, as well as reports filed by the United States Air Force. Bear Studiosâs MiG, which will be VR compatible, will feature a cockpit that is fully interactive, in depth system, high quality external/internal textures, and lighting effects. The MiG-15, developed by the Soviet Union, is one of the first jet fighters in the world to employ a swept wing design. The fighter saw great success during the Korean War and was later used as the base design for the more advanced MiG-17. The MiG-15bis was a late variant that came equipped with a better performing engine that greatly improved the planeâs Â thrust-to-weight ratio. Currently, the plane can be purchased from the JustFlight webstore or SimMarket for $29.99, excluding any sales tax that may incur. The developers recommend users to have at least 690 MB of free disk space to successfully install the product.</summary>

    <title>France VFR Releases EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-03-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. France VFR has recently released their rendition of EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg (LFSB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving three different cities in three countries due to its strategic location near the border tripoint between France, Germany, and Switzerland.Â   Dating back to the mid-1940s, the airport was part of a Swiss-French plan to build a joint airport, which almost started in the 1930s but was shattered by a looming World War. Once the dust had finally settled, around 1946, they went on with the project, with the French providing the land and the Swiss covering the construction costs. It was officially opened in May of that year, with a provisional runway (1,200m long). The runway saw expansion work in the 50s, 60s, and 70s when it finally reached its current length (3,900 meters).Â   Basel reached the 1 million passenger/year mark in 1984, doubling down in 1992 and rising to 3 million in 1998 when Swissair inaugurated their service to Newark with their A310s and A330s.Â   In the 2000s, Swissair started facing financial issues, resulting in the extinguishment of the Newark route, with the company following suit a year later, causing a drop in passenger activity as it was the largest operator in Basel. It wasnât until 2004 when easyJet embraced the airport as their new base and brought the passenger figures to an incredible 4 million in 2006.Â   As a curiosity, Basel is one of the few airports in the world operated by two countries and governed by an international convention. The airport and its HQ are in France, but it features a Swiss customs area and border, with a 2.5km customs-free road to Basel, bypassing French clearance. But it goes even further than that, as the airport building is split in two, with a French and Swiss section under their own rules. It also sports three (!) IATA codes: BSL, MLH, and EAP.  The passenger figures currently sit at 9 million passengers yearly, with a huge part of them transported by EasyJet Switzerland (Basel is one of their hubs), with a massive intra-European network. Corendon and WizzAir also offer their fair share of destinations. Itâs also visited by many mainstream European carriers such as Austrian Airlines, British Airways, KLM, and Lufthansa.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution ground textures, detailed ground markings, photo-realistic 3D buildings, realistic night lighting, custom jetways, custom vegetation, and geo-referenced data.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $8.76, requiring at least 534.78 MB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Teikof Studio has recently released their rendition of Scarlett MartÃ­nez International Airport (MPSM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Rio Hato in Panama.  Originally built as an Air Force Base, Rio Hato was of great importance during WW2, helping defend the Panama Canal. It closed not much after the war but was still used as an auxiliary military landing field until the 1990s.  The airport was recently rebuilt using most of the military infrastructure from the 1940s as a baseline to cut costs (yet it still cost 53 million dollars). The runway and terminal underwent rehabilitation, and the Pan-American Highway, which previously crossed the runway, got its tunnel.  Itâs named after Scarlett MartÃ­nez, a 22-year-old copilot that was on a flight that disappeared for six days in 2000 (it crashed against the Pito Carreto mountain in Comarca Kuna Yala).  Itâs served by four airlines: Air Panama, Air Transat, Arrendamientos AÃ©reos, and Sunwing Airlines (the only one with a fixed schedule to Toronto-Pearson). Most of the other flights are either chartered or seasonal. The airport averages a little less than 70,000 passengers a year. The scenery features PBR texturing, high-quality ground markings with wear and tear, landside buildings, and the Pan-American Highway. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $12.73, requiring at least 111.14 MB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. LeAeroDesign has recently released their rendition of Seoul-Incheon International Airport (RKSI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the largest airport in South Korea and among the busiest in the world, with a yearly average of 70 million passengers!  Incheon opened in 2001 to replace Gimpo International Airport as the main airport in South Korea and handle the extra international air traffic that the former airport was unable to (as seen during the 1988 Olympics and the early 90s). Construction work started in 1992 on reclaimed land between Yeongjong Island and Youngyu Island, taking eight years to finish and facing an economic crisis delay.Â   It is the main hub for Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, Jeju Air, and Polar Air Cargo. The current record figures revolve around 71 million passengers a year, with Korean Air being responsible for 26% of the market share, followed by Asiana Airlines and Jeju Air with 18.04% and 8.09%, respectively. Destination-wise, Hong Kong is the busiest, with 3,149,768 passengers, followed by Osaka-Kansai (2,840,003), and Tokyo-Narita (2,783,677).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of Seoul-Incheon, with highly detailed 3D models, highly-detailed 3D markings, PBR optimization, photorealistic terrain, high-detail taxi lights with realistic light visibility angles, enhanced 3D lighting, correct localizer &amp; glideslope path, realistic pushback procedures and VDGS (GSX Pro dependant).  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $23.34, requiring at least 4 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
