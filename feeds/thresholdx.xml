    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Lisium Design has recently released their rendition of Palanga International Airport (EYPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the town of Palanga in Lithuania with a yearly average of 300,000 passengers. â The airport was built during the post-WW2 period, aiming to replace the former Palanga Airport that sat 7 km east of the new one. It was originally a military airport, controlled by the Soviet Unionâs Air Force. The civil airport conversion only came to be nearly twenty years later, in 1963.Â  â Between 1994 and 1997, the airport underwent substantial renovation work, with a revamped passenger terminal, featuring ICAO-compliant passenger services and luggage handling, a full control center renovation, followed by a runway resurfacing. â With Lithuania joining the European Union in 2004, the passenger figures skyrocketed, a 60% difference compared to the previous year. With extra passengers came the necessity to expand once again, improvement of which happened in 2007, increasing the terminal area by two thousand square meters to comply with the Schengen border crossing regimen. Later that year, the runway was extended to the current 2,280 meters. â Itâs served by airBaltic (Riga), Norwegian Air Shuttle (Oslo), Ryanair (Dublin, London-Stansted), and Scandinavian Airlines (Copenhagen, Oslo). â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution textures, PBR, parallax interiors, custom night lighting, a true-to-life ground layout, animated models, GSX and AREX compatibility, and high quality models of the airport and its surrounding buildings. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $19.23, requiring at least 1.20 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aerosoft has recently released their rendition of Marseille Provence Airport (LFML) for X-Plane 12, the sixth busiest airport in France with a yearly average of 9,390,491 passengers.  The airport started operations in 1922, on a 230-ha site 2 kilometers from Marignane, with a seaplane station and a 200-meter pier. It was one of France's main points of operation for flying boats, hosting AeropÃ³stale, Air Union, and even Pan American World Airways, although briefly.Â   The passenger terminal was rebuilt in 1961, designed by architect Fernand Pouillon (exterior) Â and Maxime Old (interior), increasing its passenger handling capabilities. Thirty years later, in 1992, they expanded the terminal even further with the construction of Hall B.  In 2006, they opened a new terminal (MP2) aimed at budget airlines such as Ryanair, one of Marseille's most popular carriers. It's their biggest base in France, with 60 routes and more than 240 weekly departures.  The airport is served by many airlines, including Air France, Aer Lingus, Air Transat, Austrian, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, easyJet, Eurowings, KLM, Lufthansa, SWISS, Tap, Turkish, Volotea, and Vueling. It offered 132 regular destinations in 2013.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality 3D objects, native weather effects, high-resolution orthophoto, realistic ground textures, accurate dynamic night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, SAM integration, custom animated jetways, and more.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda Design hasÂ recently announcedÂ the next member of their Dynamic Generation Series lineup: the Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander, a British light utility aircraft and regional airliner in production since 1965.  The BN2 took off for the first time in June 1965, initially powered by Rolls-Royce Continental IO-360B, and then later replaced by a set of Lycoming O-540-Es. The first production unit flew for the first time two years later, the year when it got its US certification.  Thrandaâs version replicates the BN-2A Islander, which came out in 1969 with aerodynamic and flight equipment improvements, including lower-drag engine cowlings, a bigger rear baggage area, and slightly more powerful engines.  One of its key features is its ability to operate from unprepared airstrips, including grass and gravel runways. It is a popular choice for remote and inaccessible locations where traditional runways may be limited or absent. Its STOL capabilities allow it to take off and land in challenging conditions, such as short runways and rough terrain, making it ideal for island hopping, humanitarian missions, surveillance, and aerial survey work.  It has a seating capacity for up to nine passengers, although it can be easily reconfigured for cargo transportation. Its large cabin provides ample space for passengers or cargo, and the aircraft can be equipped with various interior layouts to suit specific requirements. The cabin can also be modified to accommodate medical equipment for air ambulance operations or fitted with specialized equipment for surveillance and reconnaissance missions.  Powered by two piston engines, usually the Lycoming O-540 or the Textron Lycoming TIO-540, the BN2A Islander has a cruising speed of around 140 knots (160 mph or 260 km/h) and a range of approximately 800 nautical miles (920 miles or 1,480 kilometers). Its fuel efficiency and relatively low operating costs have contributed to its popularity among operators worldwide.  The little airplane has been utilized in various applications, including regional airline operations, charter services, military missions, border patrol, fisheries protection, search and rescue operations, aerial surveying, and environmental monitoring. Its reliability and robustness have made it well-suited for operations in harsh environments and demanding conditions.  As of October 2019, 800 islanders were still flying out of the 1,280 built.Â  â Thereâs no information regarding features, pricing, or the release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSimStudios has recently released their rendition of Calgary International Airport (CYYC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in Canada with a yearly average of 14,452,000 passengers.  The airport was built in the late 30s, with a hangar financed by Trans-Canada Airlines and three runways funded by the Department of Transportation. It was initially named McCall Airfield after a Calgarian WW1 hero.  WW2 had Calgary International be repurposed as a fuel and maintenance stop for war aircraft and, later, housing a military flight training school. In the meantime, they continued to get regular passenger flights.  The end of World War 2 saw Calgary getting infrastructure improvements, including additional hangars, a fourth runway, and a passenger terminal, a repurposed hangar.Â   It turned out the repurposed hangars were not enough for the traffic boom of the 50s, leading to the construction of a new passenger terminal in 1956, designed by then architecture student Ken Bond. It was one of the most modern terminals in Canada back in the day.  Twenty years later, the once brand-new terminal could no longer handle the new passenger volume, forcing the city to spend $130 million on a 600,000 square feet terminal, which exists to this day.  More recently, in 2016, Calgary International got a new terminal, costing 1.6 billion dollars, covering 186,000 square meters of land and adding 24 new aircraft gates and a super modern passenger screening system with sustainability in mind.  Itâs a hub for WestJet, flying to multiple destinations in the Americas and Europe. Air Canada and Flair are two other prominent operators with a significant destination list.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution textures, fully detailed terminal interiors, realistic night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, and more.  Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ  and FSimStudios' Store for roughly $21.44, requiring at least 7.12 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to Tang0 for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSDreamTeam has recently released their rendition of George Bush Intercontinental Airport (KIAH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 12th busiest airport in the United States with a yearly average of 41 million passengers.  Inaugurated in 1969, it quickly became Houstonâs busiest airport, getting all the scheduled passenger traffic that once flew into William P. Hobby, which remained open but just for general aviation traffic. It wasnât until 1971 with Southwest Airlines that William P. Hobby Airport would also offer commercial scheduled services again.  The airport has five terminals, 161 gates, and support for jumbo jets such as the A380 and the 747 (terminal D).  Itâs a hub for United Airlines, offering multiple global destinations, truly an intercontinental operation. United Express, their regional branch, also provides a significant domestic route network. Spirit Airlines and American Airlines also serve Houston with many domestic destinations.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a realistic airport definition file, a customized GSX Pro integration, full dynamic lights, PBR texturing, Parallax shaders, the new terminal c modeled from scratch with full interiors, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. DominicDesignTeam has recently released their rendition of Philadelphia International Airport (KPHL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 21st busiest airport in the United States with a yearly average of 19.6 million passengers. â Built as a training field in 1925, PHL got its first terminal building only 15 years later, in 1940, when they got their fair share of passenger traffic that once used to fly into Camden Central Airport instead because Philadelphia lacked the infrastructure. â The military personnel demands of World War 2 converted it into a First Air Force training field, organizing and preparing various fighter and air bomber groups throughout the war. It was handed back to the city as soon as the war was over. It was also when the airport was granted its international status. â In the 1950s, the airport got a newÂ  terminal and underwent heavy expansion work, lasting up until 1970, when the entire structure was modernized. Two new terminals were built in the same decade, starting with Terminal D in 1973, and Terminal E in 1977.Â  â American Airlines holds the majority of the market share with 63.75%, offering a considerable amount of destinations, domestic and international. Frontier is second with 11.02%, followed by Spirit, Delta, and Southwest, with 6.59%, 6%, and 4.51%, respectively. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, dynamic lighting, real ground markings, hand-crafted pavement textures, custom jetway, custom object animation, and AI airline parking codes.Â  Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.99, requiring at least 704.85 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. WorldSky Studios has recently released their rendition of Lombok International Airport (WADL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the island of Lombok in Indonesia with a yearly average of 4 million passengers.  Opened in 2011 to replace Selaparang Airport, the only airport serving the island, Lombok International allowed the island to receive widebody traffic, which used to be nearly impossible with the former airport and its 2,100m long runway. Lombokâs runway is 1,200 meters longer, accommodating airplanes such as the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A330.  With a total area of 551.8 hectares, it is the second largest airport in the country after Soekarno-Hatta International, serving the metropolitan area of Jakarta.  There are expansion plans in mind for the near future (by 2028), increasing the terminal area to 28,750 square meters and adding 700 meters of runway length, along with an apron extension (from the current 63,294 square meters to 74,514).  Itâs served by Batik Air, Citilink, Garuda Indonesia, Indonesia AirAsia, Lion Air, Scoot, Super Air Jet, and WingsAir.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed buildings, custom ground textures, PBR texturing, custom aerial imagery, a terminal interior, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $9.75, requiring at least 735 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimulacÃ­on Extrema has recently released their rendition of Cataratas del IguazÃº International Airport (SARI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Puerto IguazÃº in Argentina with a yearly average of 1,000,000 passengers.  Inaugurated in 1943 as âPuerto IguazÃº Airport,â it originally featured a small terminal with a short runway catering to the transportation needs of the local population and businesses in the region.Â   With the popularity growth of the Iguazu Falls, a nearby landmark, the passenger figures have risen considerably, which led to many infrastructure improvements and expansions.  In 1996, they inaugurated a brand new passenger terminal, increasing the airportâs capacity by a significant amount and allowing it to handle more traffic.  Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas (Buenos AiresâAeroparque, CÃ³rdoba, Rosario, Salta, San Salvador de Jujuy, TucumÃ¡n), Flybondi (Buenos Aires-Aeroparque), and JetSmart Argentina (Buenos AiresâAeroparque, Buenos AiresâEzeiza).Â   The scenery shows how the airport will look after completing the new improvement plan. It has high-quality custom jetways, custom ground textures, and a fully detailed control tower with its interior.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.93, requiring at least 633.45 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimulaciÃ³n Extrema has recently released their rendition of Esquel Airport (SAVE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Esquel in Argentine Patagonia with a yearly average of 40,000 passengers.  Dating back to the early 20s, when the Argentine military recognized the strategic importance of establishing airfields in remote areas of the country, leading to the construction of a landing strip in Esquel in 1928.  With the increased air travel demand in the 1950s, the landing strip was finally expanded, along with the construction of a terminal building and its subsequent inauguration as a civilian airport.  Many upgrades followed throughout the next decades, culminating in its international status in 2001, opening up opportunities for tourism and business. It quickly became the gateway to Argentinian Patagonia.  To this day, itâs still an important economic driver for the city and its region, taking people to stunning national parks like the Los Alerces National Park.  Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas with a flight to Buenos Aires - Aeroparque.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport after the construction work is finished, with high-quality PBR texturing, custom jetways, custom ground textures, and a fully modeled terminal interior.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.86, requiring at least 614 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Taxi2Gate Releases Orlando International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/647749b784a7d531f0620a1f_mco1-min.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="3708726"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Taxi2Gate has recently released their second scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator: a rendition of Orlando International Airport (KMCO), the busiest airport in Florida and seventh in the United States with a yearly average of 50 million passengers.  Orlando International started its life as Orlando Army Air Field #2 in 1942, an auxiliary field to the Orlando Army Air Base, now known as Orlando Executive Airport. Although very briefly, it was used for aircraft testing right after the war.Â   The Korean War saw its return as a strategic air command facility, housing B-47 Stratojets and KC-97 Stratofreighters. Then, during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, it became a temporary FOB for fighter bombers and reconnaissance aircraft flying over Cuba.Â   Between 1974 and 1975, control of the airport was given to the FAA, where it finally became a civil-only airport. Previously, it was a joint civil-military airport, which was back then a model for other civil joint-military airports in operation (some are still operating today). After that agreement, in 1961, many airlines shifted their operation from the old Herndon Airport to Orlando International.Â   The opening of the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in 1971 transformed Orlando into a major tourist destination, attracting traffic from all over, be it nationwide, South America, Asia, and Europe.Â   In 1978, they started constructing the current Landside terminal and two airside on the west side of the terminal, which reached completion in 1981. The original international concourse opened in 1984, and Airside 4 was finished in 1990 with a new International concourse. Arside 2, completing the North Terminal complex, reached its completion in 2000.  The airport has 93 gates, divided between three terminals: A, B, and C, with two airside each on A and B.Â   Itâs a hub for Silver Airways and a focus city for Avelo Airlines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, and Spirit. Southwest leads the passenger market share with 23.54% of the yearly figures, followed by Spirit, Delta, and Frontier with 15.85%, 14.05%, and 13.06%, respectively.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom photoscenery, a detailed custom mesh, full-detail buildings, numerous static objects, fencing, an up-to-date AFCAD, dynamic night lighting, PBR texturing, and more. The developers recommend turning off photogrammetry to avoid terraforming issues on bridges.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $25.77, requiring at least 2.35 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
