    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Impulse Simulations has recently released their rendition of Alice Springs Airport (YBAS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Alice Springs, Australia, with a yearly average of 600,000 passengers.  The airport, originally named Seven Mile Aerodrome, was built in the 1940s by the Australian Department of Defence and used by the Royal Australian Air Force and the USAF during World War 2. It was an important refueling and staging facility run by No. 57 Operational Base Unit. It only got its current name way after the war, in 1958.  As a curiosity, it has the first large-scale aircraft boneyard outside of the United States. Operating since 2014, the Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage offers a dry and safe environment for long-term storage of airplanes, be it a functioning plane but not in use or decommissioned units that will be scrapped for parts.  It is served by Airnorth (Darwin, Katherine, Tennant Creek), Alliance Airlines (charter), Qantas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney), QantasLink (Adelaide, Darwin), and Virgin Australia (Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with realistic ground &amp; apron texturing, custom night lighting, a partially replicated cafe interior, full PBR texturing, custom animations, custom vegetation &amp; grass, a detailed static graveyard, over a hundred custom-modeled objects and buildings, custom taxiway signage, 20,000 hand placed objects, and more than a hundred custom assets.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $19.90, requiring at least 3.34 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. EcuaVirtual3D has recently released their rendition of Seymour Galapagos Ecological Airport (SEGS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the island of Baltra, one of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands in Ecuador. Itâs the third busiest airport in the country, with a yearly average of 500,000 passengers.  The airport was originally built by the United States during World War II as a military base for surveillance of the Pacific Ocean. After the war, the airport was used mainly for commercial traffic (and as a stopover for flights between South America and North America). It was eventually handed over to the Ecuadorian government in the 1960s.  In the 2000s, it was renovated to meet the requirements of the increasing number of tourists visiting the Galapagos Islands, designed with an eco-friendly concept, keeping in mind the fragile ecosystem of the Islands. The new terminal, built with recycled steel tubes from oil drilling operations in the Amazon, uses clean, renewable technologies such as solar energy, wind farms, and seawater desalination. It became the worldâs first âgreenâ airport in 2012.  The airport was named after British naval officer and scientist Sir Seymour de Ricci, who visited the Galapagos Islands in the early 1900s and contributed significantly to the scientific knowledge of the region.Â   Due to its location in a sensitive ecosystem, the airport has implemented strict regulations to minimize the impact of air traffic on the environment. For example, the airport uses solar panels to generate electricity and a rainwater harvesting system to conserve water. The airport also has a waste management system to minimize the impact of garbage on the environment.  Itâs served by Avianca Ecuador, Equair, and LATAM Ecuador, with direct flights to Guayaquil and Quito.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a faithful replica of the terminal, custom taxiway signage, custom static objects, HDR lighting, custom textures with ambient occlusion, custom approach lighting systems, and a custom mesh around the airport.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.38, requiring at least 112.20 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. 3DVirtualSim has recently released their rendition of Brest Bretagne Airport (LFRB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Brest in western France with a yearly average of 1 million passengers.  The airportâs origin dates back to World War I when the US Army built two airship hangars, which were abandoned right after the war until the late 1930s when it also got an airstrip. The air base, though, didnât survive World War 2, with its infrastructure being destroyed by air raids, rendering it practically useless.Â   Rebuilding efforts only took place in the early 1950s, with the airport being reopened for commercial use in 1952, connecting Brest to Ouessant and Paris by the wings of Air Inter.Â   With the popularization of air travel and the consequent increase in passenger volume, the airport underwent a huge expansion project in 1986, followed by a runway extension six years later, transforming the airport into a diversion ground for transatlantic flights. By 1989, the airport was averaging 500,000 passengers a year for the first time.  In December 2007, they inaugurated a brand new terminal, with 22,000 square meters of total area, able to accommodate up to 1.8 million passengers a year, with two wide-body jetways and fourteen stands for medium and small aircraft. Itâs shaped like a manta ray.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, an intricately modeled interior, dynamic jetways, reworked aerial imagery to match Bingâs colorimetry, realistic ground textures, and custom night lighting.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.62, requiring at least 1.39 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Barelli MSFS Addon has recently released their rendition of Crotone-SantâAnna Airport (LIBC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a domestic airport serving the city of Crotone in Calabria (Southern Italy) with a yearly average of 169,780 passengers.  The airport was built in 1941 to support the war industry with air transport of nitric acid and nitrates required to manufacture explosives originating from the chemical plants of Montecatini and Pertusola Sud, both close to Crotone. Two years later, in 1943, the entire airport was destroyed by 50 B.24 bombers.  Twenty years later, it became an operational base for ITAVIA, flying passengers to Ciampino and mail to Fiumicino (both are Rome airports). The advent of Lamezia Terme Airport slowly killed the flights, eventually leading to the closure of their Crotone base in 1979.  In 2012, the airport was upgraded with an ILS system, allowing for safe operation even during bad weather conditions and poor visibility. Three years later, the airportâs management company filed for bankruptcy, with the airport ceasing operations a few months after.  In 2017, Calabrese Airport Company took the helm, reopening the airport for flight operations in November, with Ryanair reactivating their scheduled flights in 2018. They are the only airline operating at Crotone, with flights to Venice, Milan, and Bologna.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a custom 3D model of the terminal, custom ground markings, and custom clutter.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.42, requiring at least 59.97 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. StarSim has recently released their rendition of Philadelphia International Airport (KPHL) for X-Plane 11 and 12, the 21st busiest airport in the United States with a yearly average of 19.6 million passengers.  The airport site has been used for aeronautical activities since 1925 when the Pennsylvania National Guard began using it as a training airfield. Two years later, it became âPhiladelphia Municipal Airport,â despite not having an actual passenger terminal until 1940, which forced airlines to use the nearby Camden Central Airport instead (they all moved to PHL once they finally built a terminal).  It was heavily used during WW2 by the USAF as a training airfield, organizing and training multiple fighter and bomber groups throughout the war.  It was granted international status in 1945 when American Overseas Airlines started their direct flights to Europe. By 1957, the airport had over 30 weekday departures by the wings of Eastern, TWA, United, American, National, Capital, Allegheny, and Delta.  Nowadays, PHL is dominated by American Airlines (63.75%), the dominance of which dates back to the US Airways days, way before the merger, starting in the 1980s and gaining major strength in 2003, when most of their hub operations were shifted from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. It was their largest international hub and second-largest overall behind Charlotte and has since shifted hands to American Airlines after the merger in 2015. Frontier (11.02%), Spirit Airlines (6.59%), Delta Air Lines (6.00%), and Southwest Airlines (4.51%) take the remainder of the market share.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a fully modeled interior for all seven terminals, high-resolution PBR texturing for ground and objects, animated custom jetways, realistic custom mesh, custom road network, accurate 2023 airport layout, and optimized for X-Plane 12 and its new features, while also being compatible with X-Plane 11.  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $24.00, requiring at least 3.56 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Publishes Long-Awaited Development Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-05-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fnxav2" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6467e5a8e1ec2e644b4d3ec4_iae.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="78866"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently published a newÂ development update, celebrating their A320's first year of release and teasing some of what will come on the V2 update: new engine model, new fonts, flight model improvements, and more. â They begin by thanking everyone for the support over the first year and explaining why the aircraft hasn't gotten any updates as of late: a strategic decision to prioritize work on a more substantial update that could address more things at once. "While I understand this may be frustrating in the short term, we are also incredibly happy with the results of this painful process - and truly believe that there was no quicker, or better way of producing these necessary upgrades for you", completed Aamir Thacker, Fenix Sim's CEO.  The long-awaited IAE engines are now in beta, featuring their proprietary external engine model technology, built on thousands of man-hours worth of work. "The degree of accuracy we were aiming for required that we have concrete, real life, data points to build the model around", they said. Fenix has made sure to model every aspect of the engine, ensuring it was as close as possible to the real-life data they have covered. To further expand their IAE engine development, they have teased its accuracy with different startup demonstrations, albeit without sounds yet, as they claim to be still working on that.  The next "victim" of the upcoming update was the fonts, which were entirely reworked and built on hundreds of high-resolution imagery sourced from their network of technicians and pilots. "We are very pleased with the result so far - but work continues on this project, with further nips and tucks required to font thickness and bolding amongst other minor details, along with the full completion of the various other display elements," they said, followed by two images showing the before and after. â  As if the list of improvements couldn't get any bigger, they have been working hard on lowering the VRAM footprint and improving its performance while also explaining why it used to be so demanding beforehand, dating back to a choice they made in 2020 back when the simulator's SDK did not support the sort of advanced display drawing technology they required to achieve what was envisioned. Things have changed since then, and they have addressed it by switching to a new display rendering method. VRAM-wise, they have performed lots of testing to reduce the memory usage without negatively impacting the visuals, reducing the memory usage by 50% inside the cockpit while also gaining a quality boost.  Lighting is another thing that changed for V2, with shadow-casting lights that have zero performance hit compared to standard/default lights, generating results that, according to the developers, are closer to real life.  The flight model was also not left behind, with fixes targeting crosswind takeoffs, crosswind landings, takeoff pitch input for rotation, and landing issues, followed by a collection of demonstrative videos.  The avionics will also be updated, bringing multiple improvements, including mitigating VNAV bugs, wrong DECEL point calculations, general system behavior errors, hydraulic system improvements, issues with auto flight, FMA improvements, crash fixes, and more. They will expand on that later once the update rolls out.  They finish off with an EFB showcase, which has been rewritten, migrating from a pure Javascript and PHP codebase to a more modern Angular front-end application powered by a C# backend, allowing their developers to work seamlessly on an industry-standard codebase, accelerating the development of new features for the EFB with greater flexibility and extensibility. They mention it's much faster to navigate between "apps," allowing them to remove the transition effects between pages and yield an overall smoother experience. The takeoff performance calculation was moved from the server side to the client side, making everything faster and more accurate on the speeds and landing data.  The Fenix A320 is available on theÂ FenixSim StoreÂ for roughly $62.22, requiring at least 3.79 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. WingSim has recently released their rendition of Las Brujas Airport (SKCZ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Corozal in Colombia with a yearly average of 46,100 passengers.  It was built on the immediacy of a witch-burning site from the Inquisition days, commonly referred to as âLas Brujas,â meaning âThe Witches,â hence the airportâs name.  The airport was inaugurated in July 1939, with a SCADTA (current Avianca) Sikorsky S-38 being the first airplane to land on Las Brujas.Â   It was recently modernized by its operator, the Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, expanding the passenger terminal, extending the runway, constructing a cargo terminal, adding a covered walkway for passengers, improving the sanitary infrastructure, and repaving the apron, along with other minor changes and improvements.  Itâs served by EasyFly and Satena, flying to MedellÃ­n-Olaya Herrera and BogotÃ¡, respectively.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a 3D model of the passenger terminal, custom ground markings, a true-to-life taxiway layout, custom ground clutter, and custom night lighting.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $7.58, requiring at least 276.52 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RFscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Treviso Airport (LIPH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Treviso in Italy and the neighboring towns of Venice and Padua, with a yearly average of 3 million passengers.  Built in the 1930s to meet the needs of the Treviso Air Club and inaugurated by Benito Mussolini himself, the airport only got its first passenger terminal nearly twenty years later, in 1953, the same year when Treviso got its first international flights (to London and Vienna, operated by BAE and Austrian, respectively).Â   For a long time until the opening of Tessera (Venice Airport), Treviso was also the airport of choice for passengers visiting Venice.Â   In 2007, the airport got a new terminal named after Antonio Canova, a famous local sculptor. It expanded its passenger handling capabilities and became Venice's de facto secondary airport, fully embraced by low-cost carriers like Ryanair.Â   It's served by Ryanair (Alicante, AmmanâQueen Alia, Beauvais, Berlin, Billund, BucharestâOtopeni, Budapest, Charleroi, Cork, Crotone, Eindhoven, Fez, Hahn, KrakÃ³w, MÃ¡laga, Malta, Marrakesh, Palma de Mallorca, Porto, PoznaÅ, Prague, Riga, Seville, Sibiu, Sofia, Tallinn, Tel Aviv, TenerifeâSouth, Thessaloniki, Trapani, Valencia, Vilnius, WarsawâModlin) and Wizz Air (BucharestâOtopeni, Cluj-Napoca, IaÈi, Skopje, Suceava, TimiÈoara, Tirana), with a significant route network encompassing most of Europe and some of Africa.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom buildings, custom ground textures, a true-to-life taxiway layout, custom ground clutter, and custom airport vehicles.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.23, requiring at least 161.53 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Lisium Design has recently released their rendition of Palanga International Airport (EYPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the town of Palanga in Lithuania with a yearly average of 300,000 passengers. â The airport was built during the post-WW2 period, aiming to replace the former Palanga Airport that sat 7 km east of the new one. It was originally a military airport, controlled by the Soviet Unionâs Air Force. The civil airport conversion only came to be nearly twenty years later, in 1963.Â  â Between 1994 and 1997, the airport underwent substantial renovation work, with a revamped passenger terminal, featuring ICAO-compliant passenger services and luggage handling, a full control center renovation, followed by a runway resurfacing. â With Lithuania joining the European Union in 2004, the passenger figures skyrocketed, a 60% difference compared to the previous year. With extra passengers came the necessity to expand once again, improvement of which happened in 2007, increasing the terminal area by two thousand square meters to comply with the Schengen border crossing regimen. Later that year, the runway was extended to the current 2,280 meters. â Itâs served by airBaltic (Riga), Norwegian Air Shuttle (Oslo), Ryanair (Dublin, London-Stansted), and Scandinavian Airlines (Copenhagen, Oslo). â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution textures, PBR, parallax interiors, custom night lighting, a true-to-life ground layout, animated models, GSX and AREX compatibility, and high quality models of the airport and its surrounding buildings. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $19.23, requiring at least 1.20 GB of free hard disk space to install.
