    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, scenery developer TaiModels released Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport (YSSY) for X-Plane 11. The airport, created using 4k textures, custom SAM jetways, and custom ground mesh, will serve as the gateway for pilots looking to visit one of Australia's most well known metropolises. According to the developers, Sydney Airport has been recreated to mirror its real life counterpart. Some notable features of the scenery include high detailed models, interior models for terminal 1 and 2, custom animated objects, PBR textures, and optimizations for best performances. For a complete list of features, check out the productâs store page. Sydney Airport, located only 5 miles away from Sydneyâs central districts, is the main international airport that serves the region. One of the busiest airports in Australia, YSSY serves as a hub for international travel, connecting the country to almost every continent in the world. In 2018 alone, the airport handled some 45 million passengers and was nominated by Skytrax as the worldâs 20th best airport. Currently, TaiModelsâs Sydney Airport can be purchased on iniBuildsâs webstore for Â£20.99 GBP/$27.50 USD, excluding any sales tax that may occur. The product is supported all three operating systems and the developers recommend the users to have at least 1.86GB of free disk free for successful installation.</summary>

    <title>DCDesigns Releases Concorde for MSFS2020</title>
    <updated>2022-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aircraft developer DCDesigns has released their rendition of the Aerospatiale Concorde for MSFS2020. The product is accompanied by MSFS native materials, a realistic flight model, and a complete operations manual. While it's unlikely that you don't know much about the Concorde, here's a bit of a history lesson anyway. The Aerospatiale/BAC Concorde is a French-British afterburning turbojet supersonic airliner that operated at a cruising speed of Mach 2.02. Considered a technological marvel, it contains the title of the most successful supersonic aircraft, beating its only "viable" competitor, the Tupolev Tu-144. It initially garnered interest from many airlines, such as Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, but production delays and hesitance regarding the airframes viability as a profitable mechanism led to mass cancellations of orders, leaving only British Airways and Air France to operate the aircraft. The Concorde is still the only "successful" supersonic airliner to date, even though the airframe's last flight took place in 2003. Today, most Concordes are presented at notable museums such as the Intrepid and Boeing museums, existing as figures of an incredible legacy of the past.Â  Rewinding to the DCDesigns rendition of the Concorde, it's imperative to mention that the developer designed the aircraft intending to simplify the plane so that it is accessible to all users without requiring "intense" studying to fly. Therefore, it's important to keep expectations humble as it doesn't compete with the likes of the FSLabs Concorde, for example.Â  DCDesigns' Concorde Features: You can obtain the DCDesigns Concorde for MSFS2020 through the JustFlight store for $39.99. In addition, aspiring pilots can check out the release trailer beforehand to get a glimpse of the aircraft in action. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The team over at FSimStudios has released their visual rendition of Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This release has brought an all-new look to the small regional Canadian airport. Before Toronto Pearson International Airport was constructed, Billy Bishop Airport served as Toronto's main airport. Being built in 1939, the airport served as the main hub for all air traffic. A decade later, the Canadian Government proposed an expansion to the small airport to increase passenger traffic to the area. Later on, with the airport receiving a regional jet ban in 1983, passenger air travel slightly declined. Now in the 21st Century, the airport was approved to receive the Airbus A220 for a limited time. For this release, the team has included a feature list of what is included in the scenery package. Starting off, the package has the current 2022 layout airport and more than 20 accurate handmade models of downtown Toronto have been included. Many helipads for Toronto's hospitals have been included for our rotorcraft friends to fly to. Static Q400s are an option for users to include in their scenery as well. The full feature list is listed below: This scenery is able to be purchased over on the simMarket Store and sells for â¬13.99. </summary>

    <title>PMDG 737 for MSFS Enters the "Home Stretch"</title>
    <updated>2022-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmdg41" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6253da417c450e0a47cc1efe_image_15778.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="437320"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Robert Randazzo at PMDG SimulationsÂ has taken to the developer's forumsÂ to give more insight into the 737 for MSFS development progress. The team is nearing the end of the initial testing phase of the 737-700 and will hold a meeting next week to finalize the release date. (the above photos are sourced from PMDG's March 15th 737 update) Contextual Information PMDG intends on including the MAX product line to complement the Next Generation products. The initial release product will be the PMDG 737-700, which will consist of the passenger, cargo, and BBJ variants of the aircraft, featuring a multitude of winglet styles, configurable options, and PMDG's classic realism. The team will release an additional variant of the 737 product line in approximately six-week intervals, including 737-600, 737-800, and 737-900 for MSFS.Â  "Customer Driven Ideas" Every 737 variant will be sold separately to allow customers more flexibility to acquire the models they desire instead of purchasing variants in a large package. Another idea touted by customers was that the team intends to treat the release phase of the 737 as if it was early access. Most features will initially be available in the aircraft, but a few features won't be possible to delegate to the product line until the product releases. These product updates will be available in two-week intervals during the initial 24 week release period.Â  Features That'll Be Added After Release or Excluded Altogether. The aforementioned updates will be available to users at no cost via updates to the products.Â  What's Included in the 737 Products? Essentially, the aircraft will contain numerous features, with customized performance data, accurate flight modeling, complete flight management, realistic autopilot, and functioning LNAV, VNAV. "How is the performance?" Performance "remains quite good" the 737 should run fine if your setup can already handle other third-party aircraft. Randazzo's rig, featuring an early i9 and 2080Ti, can run the 737 well at default airports. He provided Drzewiecki Design's RNT as an example, which offers 40-45fps with the 737 in-sim, and default airports such as FMEE provide mid-to-low 50s.Â Â  Discounts Users should not expect any discount/trade-in or upgrade programs for the 737 product line, except for one scenario. If you purchased the 737 NGXu for P3D when the team offered a transition program for those who desired to buy the MSFS 737 at release, you would receive a $99.99 credit towards purchasing the 737 MSFS product line. This credit offer only applies to those who purchased the NGXu before December 31st, 2019.Â  Product Pricing is TBA at the Moment Final Thoughts Robert has shifted his focus to recording some videos to showcase the aircraft's depth and features (PMDGs YouTube channel). He mentions that this series will not be a tutorial but rather "serve as small bites of information that will allow you to quickly see the depth of features available to you as a PMDG 737 product line user." Beta testers will be able to share information and media about the upcoming aircraft beginning of next week.Â  As we all await the forthcoming news from PMDG in the coming weeks, stay tuned with Threshold as we report on all the news originating from the simulator world.Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, BlueBird Simulations posted the first development blog on its upcoming 757-200/300 series aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The short update brings the latest on the teamâs progress, new previews of the aircraft, and a quick glimpse of the developerâs plans down the line. The development update, released 2 months after the aircraft was first announced, revealed that âexterior model (including textures) is around 50-60% completeâ. In addition, the developers reported that work on the 757âs systems and flight dynamics are progressing as planned, though they will not be ready to share details on them for another few months. Finally, Bluebird Simulations teased that a new development update will be released every 4 to 6 weeks. BlueBird Simulationsâs 757 will feature two variants of the aircraft: the -200 with RR/PW engines and the -300 with RR/PW engines. According to the developerâs website, the aircraft will be equipped with everything from custom-coded systems to 4k PBR textures. Check out a previous Threshold article to learn more about the product. Currently, the developers are yet to announce a firm release date or pricing for the aircraft.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. M'M Simulations have released their visual rendition of TromsÃ¸ Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Touching down in the Scandinavia region, the team has brought their skills to the airport and its surrounding area. Being established in the 1930s, the airport was first operated by Norwegian Air. As the European Theater of WW2 began, the airport began servicing the Junkers Ju-52 for the German Luftwaffe and they began the expansion of the aerodrome. After the war, the Norwegian Air Force took over operations and began adding expansions to the airport. Years later, the Norwegian Parliament approved construction for public passenger services, with the airport opening to the public on the 14th of September, 1964. The team has included a small, but down to the point feature list. Starting, the team has accurately modeled the surrounding area and the airport grounds, alongside accurate terraforming and CGLÂ data. PBRÂ textures have been added, and a modeled interior for added user experience. Ambient animated objects and an upcoming terminal have been all included.  If you are interested in picking this scenery package up for yourself, you can find it over on the simMarket Store and sells for â¬19.00. If you are interested in any other renditions by the team, you can view their catalog on their website.</summary>
