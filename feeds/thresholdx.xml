    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlyTampa has recently released their rendition of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for X-Plane 11 and 12, the worldâs third busiest airport in terms of international passenger traffic (as of 2021) and the third busiest in Europe volume-wise, with 70 million passengers yearly.Â   Schiphol is a hub for Corendon Dutch Airlines, KLM, KLM Cargo, KLM Cityhopper, Transavia, TUI fly Netherlands, and Martinair, and a base for easyJet. As previously mentioned, being the third busiest airport in international passenger traffic, the destination network is significant, covering most of the globe. Due to KLMâs extensive International coverage, the intercontinental visitorâs list is not too big, although not tiny either.Â   The airportâs origin dates back to 1916, when it opened as a military airbase for WW1, gradually losing its military role after the war, with plenty of civilian use. By the time it was captured by the Germans in 1940, it already had four runways at 45-degree angles. It wasnât long until the airport was rendered useless by multiple bombings, yet soon rebuilt and crowned the main airport of the Netherlands.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR materials, high-resolution ground textures with custom weather maps, detailed surrounding scenery with numerous custom buildings, tridimensional terrain including tunnels and bridges, surrounding photoscenery, animated apron and local road traffic, dynamic lighting, animated jetways, and VDGS (requires SAM).  Itâs available onÂ FlyTampaâs WebsiteÂ for $28.00, requiring at least 3.78 GB of free disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently released a video showcasing the RJ Professionalâs Center Console with its all-new avionics in relation to the 146, demonstrating the functionality of each panel, from the radio stack to the flight deck door controls.  It is their first development update since October, where they stated the airplane was undergoing extensive testing to ensure it was behaving just like the real-life counterpart, and the digital displays were alive with the work on the now showcased center console having just finished. The Inertial Reference System (IRS) and the fully-automatic pressurization controller were pending and yet to be demonstrated.  The Avro RJ is an improved version of the British Aerospace 146, which entered production in 1992. It is the most successful British civil jet airliner program, with 387 units (including the 146). Due to its quiet engines, it was ideal for small city-based airports such as London City. Just Flightâs rendition will include all three variants of the airliner: the RJ70 (26.2m long), the RJ85 (28.6m long), and the RJ100 (31m long), along with 25 brand new liveries covering operators from all over the World. Thereâs no information on the release date or pricing yet.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations has recently released their rendition of SÃ£o Paulo Catarina International Executive Airport (SBJH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the first executive airport in Brazil with international status, and only a 30 minute drive away from SÃ£o Paulo, the biggest city in the country and the nationsâ business center.Â   Designed by Sig Bergamin, a famous brazilian architect, the airport features state-of-the-art terminals and a large hangar area, both using sustainable architectural methods, aiming for ultimate comfort and privacy. The project was aided by ACV (Airport Consulting Vienna), Ramboll (Danish engineering company), ALG (spanish consultancy company), and others (not mentioned by the airport ownerâs website). The airport was built to withstand 200 thousand take-offs and landings yearly, including intercontinental executive jets. With a 2,500m long runway, it can easily take a 738 BBJ, for example.Â   It is the only executive airport in Brazil with authorization to operate flights to New York, London and Paris. It is the sole executive gateway to the country for business fliers.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, modeled and textured with the help of over 3000 photos sent by the airport management, with a performance-friendly approach regarding the interior modeling, bearing brazilian customers in mind. It includes updated satellite imagery, an accurate mesh, and an open hangar. The developer stated plans to update the scenery once the hangars under construction are completed, along with a new taxiway.Â   Itâs available on theÂ GearDown Simulations StoreÂ for $10.01.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has just released their rendition of Bolzano Airport (LIPB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a small regional airport in South Tyrol, Northern Italy. The yearly traffic figures sit at less than 20 thousand passengers, with regional carriers like SkyAlps and Luxwing connecting the city to Berlin, DÃ¼sseldorf, and Hamburg, 7 times a week (as of December 2022).Â   In mid-2016, there was a public poll concerning the future of the airport, because the populace was unhappy with it costing chunks of money every year, with an eventual decision to liquidate the operator company and return the license to the Italian authorities, with potential closure in case of inability to find a new operator. Over 120 million euros were spent without reaching the intended result. Three years ago, the South Tyrol government managed to sell the airport to ABD Holding for 3.8 million euros. The new holders went on to extend the runway to 1,462m in mid-2021.Â   The scenery features realistic HD textures created from on-site photography, an updated layout with the new runway extension, custom static DC-3 and helicopters, main terminal with interior modeling, and a custom ortho.  Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $16.57, requiring at least 2.74 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, scenery developer Burning Blue Design released their rendition of Solent Airport (EGHF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The scenery, with its up-to-date airport layout and realistic 3D models, will deliver the most immersive experience for pilots when they are looking for a weekend get-away to coastal England. According to Burning Blue Design, the team has visited the airport multiple times in order to create the most realistic product possible for the community. The scenery will be based on the latest layout of the airport and will include custom light lighting, more than 200 custom-made models ranging from hangers to control towers, and high quality PBR textures. Additionally, certain hanger doors are designed to close automatically at night and must be opened by pilots using their taxi lights. Finally, the developers have optimized the airport to have it âblend in with local Photogrammetryâ and added static aircraft as well as local landmarks. For the full list of features, check out the Orbx storepage. 	Solent Airport was built as Royal Air Force base HMS Daedalus and served as a vital role in both world wars. Post war, the airport served as a testing facility for hovercrafts before being closed in 1996. It was opened in 2015 as a civilian airfield with the name Solent Airport. Currently, Solent Airport can be purchased on Orbx or the developerâs own webstore for US$20.77, excluding any sales tax that may incur. The developer recommends potential buyers to have at least 1.31GB of free space on their hard drives in order to successfully install the product.</summary>

    <title>Parallel 42 Releases Flow for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/parflw" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/63a17e9f6a09671055752c6a_flwbig2.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="496765"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Parallel 42 has recently released Flow, their customizable menu system for Microsoft Flight Simulator, replacing the default Toolbar with an intuitive and easy-to-navigate in-game interaction wheel. Itâs said to challenge the status quo by offering a new and improved way of accessing and interacting with information within the simulator, easing the chore of navigating through the multiple options of the default toolbar.Â   The core features consist of fully resizable interface elements (helping people with vision or cognitive impairments), full access to the currently installed MSFS panels (including third-party), in-sim operability without external app requirements, and a sleek and interactive wheel offering a customizable - and toggable - alternative to the default toolbar, with static and dynamic wheels (static is always shown, dynamic is only shown on specific aircraft), and optimization for the Xbox One controller.  Flow also includes aÂ Toolbar EnhancementÂ feature, where you can either disable the old toolbar entirely or enable an enhanced version with better - and fluider - animations.Â   There are three different flavors of Flow, which follow down below:  Flow (free): The freeware version allows access to the default - and third-party - toolbar panels from an on-screen overlay, with a wheel that can be toggled on or off with a configurable key or button. It offers a modern approach to the menu system, allowing you to customize your experience for each user or aircraft.Â   Flow Essentials ($15):Â EssentialsÂ brings a selection of widgets made by Parallel 42, allowing the user to find friends, teleport, change servers, change the time of day, swap weather presets, discover different camera angles, toggle landing gear, and more. They have also included widgets for popular actions that people might want.  Flow Pro ($25):Â ProÂ caters to the power users with advanced features like the creation and sharing of custom widgets with JavaScript coding, along with Twitch integration for content creators, and Otto, a search bar for power users that allows for unit conversion, math, METAR data request, top of descent calculation, and more.  All the three flavors of Flow are available onÂ Orbx Direct, requiring at least 10.26 MB of free disk space to install. Shout out to DragonRuins for the news scoop!
