    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XSimulations has recently released their rendition of PAF Captain Guillermo Concha Iberico International (SPUR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Piura in Peru.   It has a rich and dynamic history dating back several decades. The airport was built in the 1950s as a small regional airfield, serving primarily as a hub for domestic flights. In the following decades, as the region experienced significant economic growth, the airport underwent many renovations and upgrades to accommodate the increasing demand for air travel, including the addition of modern terminals, runways, and air traffic control systems, as well as the expansion of the airport's passenger and cargo facilities. Today, the airport is a gateway to the northwestern region of Peru, connecting travelers to major destinations both within the country and abroad. With its modern facilities and growing passenger traffic, the airport continues to play a critical role in regional economic development, poised for continued growth. Itâs served by JetSmart PerÃº, LATAM PerÃº, and Sky Airline Peru, with legs to Lima and Arequipa (JetSmart only), with a yearly average of 860,000 passengers in total. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it stands, with PBR texturing, a modeled terminal interior, and military static aircraft. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $8.61, requiring at least 1.67 GB of free disk space.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlightFactor tease 777 v2 enginesÂ  The much anticipated 777 V2 from FlightFactor have recently been increasing their output of teaser content for their upcoming aircraft! In a recent post, FlightFactor has taken to Twitter to tease the different engine sounds of the incredible GE90 engines both during spool up on the ground and in the air!Â  A brief background on the GE90:Â  The GE90 is a high bypass turbofan engine that has been designed and developed by GE Aviation primarily for the 777 aircraft family. It outputs thrust ratings anywhere from 81,000 to 115,000 lbf which is absolutely incredible. The GE90 first entered service with British Airways mounted on the 777 in November of 1995. The FlightFactor 777 V2 sure looks as though it's going to be one of the most accurate representations of both the 777 and GE90 for any flight sim to date.Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Got Friends has recently released their rendition of the Revolution Mini-500 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a single-seat light helicopter from the 90s sold as a kit for homebuilding by Revolution Helicopter Corporation.Â   Designed to resemble a mini Hughes 500, the Mini-500 is powered by a Rotax 582 engine that produces around 64 horsepower, with a range of 225 miles and a maximum speed of 115 mph. The fuselage is made of tubular steel with a cabin made of foam and structured with glass fiber.Â   It first flew in 1992, with its official introduction in 1994, and a total of 500 kits sold until production ceased about six years later. The kits were sold for around $24,500, including the engine, the fiberglass enclosure, instruments (the basic pack), the electric starter, landing lights, and navigation lights. As most of the parts came pre-assembled at the factory, the total build time was around 40 hours.Â   The MSFS counterpart features custom MGL avionics, multiple visual effects (including downwash, combustion, heat, rain, and icing), a native flight model using the Helicopter SDK, interchangeable avionics (GTR-220 radio or GNS-530), and many custom liveries.  Itâs available on theÂ Got Friends ShopÂ for $15.00.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Tampa International Airport (KTPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Tampa Bay Area in Florida with more than 93 non-stop destinations throughout the globe.  Tampa is known as the birthplace of commercial airline service, when a Benoist Flying Boat took off from St. Petersburg (Florida) to Tampa Airboat Line in early 1914, consecrating itself as the first scheduled commercial flight in the world. It was a 23-mile-long flight, and the service ran for about five months. The airport itself dates back to 1928, then called Drew Field. It was heavily used during WW2 for training, where it underwent modernization and expansion.Â   Post-war, it went back to its original role of being just an airport, with its first international flights to begin a couple of years later, in 1950. A new terminal reached completion not long after, in 1952. A decade later, with the popularity of jet aircraft and many new airlines flying to Tampa, expansion became a priority, with the authorities planning a replacement terminal in an undeveloped site at the airport, whose production kicked off in 1968 and completion came three years later, increasing the capacity and consolidating Tampa as an important domestic and international destination.Â   The airport collects several quality awards, including Best Overall U.S. Airport in 2007 and 2008 by Zagat Survey, Second Best Airport in the World by CondÃ© Nas in 2008, and 6th place on CNNâsÂ Ten of the Worldâs Most Loved Airports, and itâs considered by Airports Council International as the best airport in America for its size (2020).  With an average of 20 million passengers yearly, Tampa is served by most major domestic airlines, including Southwest (27.81% of the market share), Delta Air Lines (17.52% of the market share), American Airlines (16.89% of the market share), United Airlines (10.69% of the market share), and Spirit Airlines (10.03% of the market share). The top domestic destinations list includes Atlanta (925,000 passengers), Chicago-OâHare (463,000), and Charlotte (450,000).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with an updated taxiway layout, animated passengers with âhalf-interiorâ airside and terminals, proper AI routing and vehicle pathing, realistic airline codes, custom taxi signs, custom airport lighting, a blend of custom and photorealistic imagery, animated HVAC fans, flags, and trams, handcrafted mesh with taxiway bridges, high-resolution color-graded imagery, surrounding area landmarks (Raymond James, International Plaza, Grand Hyatt, etc.).  Itâs available on Verticalsimâs Shop for $21.99, requiring at least 4.12 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds hasÂ recently announcedÂ the development of Oklahoma City Airport (KOKC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest commercial airport in Oklahoma with a yearly average of 4 million passengers.  Oklahoma City Airport, or Will Rogers World Airport, first opened in 1911 as Oklahoma City Municipal Airfield renamed 30 years later after Will Rogers. It served as a major training facility during WW2, with over fifteen air force groups stationed there over the course of the war. Post-war saw commercial activity in the late fifties, with over 48 daily commercial flights from different airlines.Â  â In the late 90s, expansion talks ensued from the old age of the original terminal, dating back to 1967. Plans launched not much later, in 2001, with the demolition of the twin concourses to make room for the new project: a larger terminal with high ceilings and modern facilities. One hundred and ten million dollars, and five years later, the project finally reached completion, with the third phase still pending.  The aforementioned third phase only happened in March 2019, finishing roughly two years later, substantially increasing the passenger handling capacity and the overall quality of the facilities.  iniBuildsâ rendition will feature an accurate rendition of the airport as it stands, with a fully modeled interior, up-to-date airport and terminal layout, HD textures, 3D people, detailed jetways, correct airline parking allocations, fully modeled landside, and custom taxi signs.Â   Thereâs no information regarding pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Simbrief is the most popular and widely used flight sim dispatch system which is offered for free by parent company Navigraph. Itâs been a considerable amount of time since anything major has changed with SimBrief after the acquisition by Navigraphâ¦ Until now that is!
