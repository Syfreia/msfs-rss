The update is available on their website for registered customers. â â A320 v1.0.3.134 [SYSTEM] Â - Adjusted custom low speed friction model to be slightly more fluidÂ  - Fixed incorrect air/ground mix factor causing irrecoverable nose down elevator after a bounced landingÂ  - Removed alpha-buffer pseudo-prot, causing issues with flare authority in certain conditions [FM]Â  - Adjusted spoiler efficacyÂ  - Improved suspension geometry and setup to reduce bouncing, absorbing more energy on touchdown and subsequently sitting lower on the groundÂ  - Added lift dumping to spoilers so the aircraft is more stable after touchdown in a crosswindÂ  - Improved aircraft's crosswind and weathervaning characteristics Â - Adjusted lateral tyre friction to prevent weight on wheels sideslip and/or unintended ice skating â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
