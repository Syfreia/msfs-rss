    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, Laminar Research published a new development update for the much anticipated X-Plane 12. The update provides a quick glance at the state of the upcoming simulator plus a brief summary of features that are complete and ones that still need additional work. According to the developers, the next milestone for the team is to release the simulator in early access. In early access, X-Plane 12, priced at $59.99, will be open for the public to purchase on X-plane.com or Steam. Users who choose to buy the simulator during this stage will receive digital keys to both X-Plane 12 and 11. DVD editions of X-Plane 12, however, will not be available for purchase until the end of Early Access. Next up, the developers addressed their progress on various aspects of the simulator. The team confirmed that the flight model, weather engine, and ATC are mostly complete, though small improvements, optimizations, and final reviews still need to be done. As for the scenery, features such as animated jetways, rain/Snow shaders, and modular tower building kit have been completed, though features such as 3D tree performance improvements, boat/seaplane 3D wake drawing, and eclectic passenger buses still need work. Finally, the update indicates that all default aircrafts except for the A330 (need custom coded FMS) and F14 (need liveries and finalization of cockpit details) have been completed. The full list of progress updates can be found here. Currently, the developers are yet to announce a release date for X-Plane 12 early access. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Xometry, the well-known scenery developer in the X-Plane and MSFS space, has returned to the iniBuildsÂ YouTube channel with a trailerÂ of their upcoming Eagle County airport for MSFS2020. Eagle is the second scenery in the developer's MSFS lineup, as they're responsible for the recently-released Victorville airport.Â  Eagle County airport is located in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. It poses a difficult challenge as its geography is located in a narrow valley, and high elevation prevents larger aircraft from operating on the field. Airlines such as American, Delta, and United service the airport with A319s, B737s, and regional jets.Â Â  iniBuilds YouTube channel did not mention a feature list, though here's the feature list from Xometry's EGEÂ for X-Plane 11: iniBuilds has not detailed EGE's release yet, but theÂ X-Plane 11 versionÂ of the airport is currently for sale for 14.99GBP and consumes nearly 2GB when downloaded. If you're interested in EGE for MSFS, keep up to date with Threshold, as we'll post any new details as soon as they come out.Â </summary>

    <title>PMDG 737-700 for MSFS Updated, -600 Previewed</title>
    <updated>2022-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The youngest siblings of the 737 family have seen some limelight on the PMDG Forum today with group chief executive Robert Randazzo announcing the release of the productâs first update post-launch. A subsequent post published shortly after gives further insight into the next entry in the series, the 737-600. Firstly though, the changes list for the -700. Randazzo describes the foremost changes: â[The update] comes with a number of changes and improvements, including updated models and associated textures, a significant update to the sound engine and dozens upon dozens of small tweaks, adjustments and improvements.â Version 3.00.0020 of the PMDG 737-700 brings the following 69 changes: Updating the product can be done via the PMDG Operations Center. Randazzo notes that some may experience some sound issues on the first post-update run of the 737. âWe have traced this to the manner in which the sim caches sounds, and it can be easily corrected by simply running the airplane, then exiting back to the world menu and launching the aircraft a second time. For reasons we don't yet understand, the sim does not update the cache on the first run, but it does on the second launch and from then on you will be fine without further need to tinker.âÂ  Turning to the -600 variant of the 737, the âthoroughbredâ Baby Boeing is running approximately seven to nine days behind the schedule dictated by PMDG in the lead up to the first variantâs release.Â  Robert Randazzo maintains that due to some âslopâ accounted for in the release schedule, the -600 âmay still roll out on timeâ later this month, and that any delay on the little brother will not have any effect on the 737-800, slated for early August. The post then launches into detailing a number of new advancements coming both for the -600 and 737 series as a whole. âFor a few years now, we have been at work conducting a full rebuild on the lateral and vertical path modeling capability for the PMDG FMS used by all of our Boeing airliners.â âThe good news is that we are preparing to insert it into testing within the PMDG 737 for MSFS, and it will then roll out to you in the forum of a free update. This modern path modeling has been something we have been building toward for some time and it will dramatically improve the accuracy of how PMDG airliners move through the sky in a 3D pathway âConcurrent with the Lateral/Vertical Path Module we have been working to build out a proper flight director roll and pitch module based upon input from some of the industryâs leading flight control logic engineers and our in house mathematical wizard. âThis has been under initial iteration testing and will also roll out as a free update shortly.â On the topic of the Universal Flight Tablet, the team remains relatively tight-lipped on progress, with Randazzo suspecting that he may have given away too much information in last weekâs update. Today, he offers a few words to the effect of âsoonâ. Other miscellaneous topics covered include another reminder to customers of the 737 NGXu who purchased in November and December 2019 that a $99.99 credit remains available for their use on the PMDG webstore and that another update for the 737 will be due ânext weekâ.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Idahoâs Boise Air Terminal has now seen an entry in Microsoft Flight Simulator courtesy of Orbx, whoâve made the city's Gowen Field their latest release for the platform.Â  The airport serves a dual civilian/military purpose and is also home to the stateâs largest building â the control tower, which stands at a not-so-impressive 295ft or approximately 90 metres. Orbxâs rendition for the sim includes the following features: Boise is served by eight airlines in the current day, with a route network of 26 destinations. This is in stark contrast to its previous passenger-serving efforts, in which customers previously awaited their aircraft in what the developer describes as an âageing Varney Airlines (now United) hangarâ. The rather more modern, current terminal was opened in 2003. You can purchase Orbx Boise for $16.70 AUD (approx. US$12.04Â |Â â¬11,23Â |Â Â£9.64) from OrbxDirect.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Scenery-making subsidiary of development house iniBuilds, iniScene, has seen a busy last couple of months -- firstly with the release of Buffalo-Niagara (KBUF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator as well as the forthcoming release of San Antonio (KSAT) for the same platform. In a development update published today, the team have given some insight into the next steps moving forwards from three of their current projects. Ubaid Mussa, iniBuilds chief executive, addressed the groupâs London Heathrow rendition first. âTo start the year, in January we released our first mega-airportÂ iniScene London Heathrow EGLL for Microsoft Flight Simulator.â âThis was a fantastic project and we worked with some great people who engage with the airport daily to create a faithful rendition. Being our first mega-airport we learnt a lot, and as you can always expect from us, have reflected and are working on an update covering performance, night lighting and greater detail on road markings.â iniScene have opened a forum thread for users to share their wish-list for a free update to the product, which you can find here. Mussa confirms that iniScene London Heathrow will not be making its way to Prepar3D or X-Plane at this time. Turning their most recent release, Buffalo, the team express their thanks for great community reception to the product -- it is also now confirmed that work has started on the X-Plane 11 rendition of KBUF, which will see the light of day in further development updates. San Antonio is the final topic brought up in today's development update. Mussa acclaims iniScene's work as 'some of our best', and that KSAT will bring details 'not seen before in some of our other products'. "We plan to start release preparations for this airport very soon, and are working on the final details!" In addition to KSAT we are currently working on a few other projects which we will share more information on in the next couple of months along with a brand new product offering for you heli pilots. The CEO says a development update regarding iniBuilds' aircraft project will come in due course.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Airbus A330 will mark the third Microsoft Flight Simulator aircraft release for German developer Aerosoft, creators of one of the platforms' first complex products in the form of the CRJ series. Earlier this week, the development house provided new previews inside and out of Airbus' smallest widebody as well as some additional insight into various features. Aerosoft founder and spokesperson Mathijs Kok once again did the honours. He was careful to note that despite virtual cockpit 3D work being complete, the team is yet to add in decals and weathering -- essentially, these previews are not entirely representative of the final product. In a subsequent post on the same forum thread, Kok shares some new exterior previews too. When questioned by one community member about the apparent 'dumbing down' of Aerosoft's Twin Otter for the Xbox platform and whether this would be mirrored in the A330, Kok had this to say. "I do not know why you think that, the modelling and texturing were absolutely not dumbed down, was simple not needed. Nor will the A330 be. Both are optimized for Xbox use though, meaning they are fully done with MSFS technology. So not 8K textures but 2K with decals ending up with detail." A price has not been decided for Aerosoft's A330 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, nor a release date as yet.  You can find the original previews on the forum thread for the aircraft here.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Creators of Rotterdam-The Hague for Microsoft Flight Simulator, RDPresets have announced that Naplesâ airport will be their next pursuit for the platform.  With this news the developer doubles the number of projects theyâve got on the go, as work on Marseille continues concurrently. â[Marseille] has hit some major bumps in the road, some items failed our Quality Assurance and are requiring some remodelling, this will take time and has set Marseille back two release slots, meaning as it stands two other airports will come before it." The developer explains that the delay is necessary to ensure quality. "But this does allow me to announce you our first new airport which is in Italian [sic], âAeroporto di Napoliâ." "Weâre incredibly proud of how this product is currently being developed and itâs going at an incredible pace. Weâre using a new texture method ensuring a higher texture resolution, but at the same time using less texture sets. "It took us some time to perfect this and arguably weâre still learning it, but we feel it is really good already and worthy enough to put it above our current Rotterdam airport quality." RDPresets want to go 'the extra mile' in ground detailing with Naples, saying that the final product will 'truly give you an idea of arriving or departing [at an airport with proper weathering]. They have not offered a release date as yet, but maintain that the first in-sim images of Naples will debut shortly. It was also revealed in the development update that the brand is working on a hub software for their products. The software will be called RDHome.
