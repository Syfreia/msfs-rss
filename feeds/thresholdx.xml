    <title>PMDG On Approach to Release for 737-700; Remains Tight-Lipped On Release Date</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG is reaching the end of the tunnel in the development of their hotly-awaited 737-700NG3. On their forums, Robert Randazzo detailed that the team remains bullish for a timely release, but is still reserved on setting a concrete release date due to several factors adding âambiguityâ to the projectâs completion, and the upcoming Sim Update 9 from Asobo additionally brings more uncertainty to the add-onâs stability with potential issues that is unforeseeable. Randazzo explained that a lot of logistics are involved in preparation for enabling the team to adapt to SU9, one of which is ensuring a stable testing environment to avoid a ânegative initial user experienceâ. A lot of details are yet to be finalised, including the release date which not even the team has a concrete answer internally, there is an âentire evaluative processâ taking place to pinpoint a date. That said, RSR reassured that the productâs launch will not be a surprise drop in store, a release date with possibly an approximate time of day will be announced prior to the release. As the team approaches the final leg of the 737-700âs development, Randazzo optimistically said that things will become much more exciting between now and the productâs release. The embargo will be lifted so testers of the add-on can share and provide additional new insights into the product, streamers who got ahold of the aircraft will have their embargo lifted as the plane is released.Â  To kickstart the beginning of the hype building, the team is currently releasing a series of walkthrough videos on the 737-700 on their YouTube channel, with an introductory video published already (embedded on top). A few hours ago, another video is published detailing the Tow Out and plans after the release of the aircraft: More videos will steadily be published in the coming days and weeks. Moving on, Randazzo has shifted to discussing the sounds that are developed for the add-on. Armen, who is principally behind the soundset, has been developing a âsound-scapeâ to match the visuals and systems fidelity of the rest of the aircraft. Stressing that the sound engine that MSFS used is âunlike anything they have every[sic] had the opportunity to work withâ, to which Armen has used the engine to its full potential. Randazzo wraps up the update by assuring that this will be a monumental release, both for the team and the flight sim community; the talent behind Vin and Jason to develop the most visually, and technically faithful 737 for MSFS combined with the delightful sonic experience from Armen that brings the bird to life.

    <title>PMDG Outlines Early Adopter Model for MSFS 737</title>
    <updated>2022-04-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, PMDG published a lengthy blog, detailing its plans for the release of its much anticipated 737NG series for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Through the blog, the developers explained in detail the Early Adopter model they will utilize for their upcoming products and outlined a general release plan for its 737s. According to PMDG, the Early Adopter model will be implemented for the first time to give the developers additional time to fully master the new technologies brought by MSFS, allowing them to gradually implement features that they couldnât provide in the past. In the Early Adopter Period that starts with the initial release of the -700, ânew features, bug fixes, model and texture improvements, performance optimizations, and increasing MSFS integration will be rolled out in update intervals spaced approximately two weeks apartâ. During this time, the -600, -800, and -900 will also be released, with new updates being made available to all four variants simultaneously. In total, the developers expect this period to run a total of 24 weeks, ending around 6 weeks after the release of the -900, though it may be extended if needed. The developers stressed that the airplanes will be fully functional during this time and this period will enable them to âexpand it beyond the initial capabilities deliveredâ. Additionally, PMDG will be providing a list of features that it will add/optimize, including ones that are currently unachievable due to SDK limitations. The list will be kept up-to-date with the roll out of each new version.Â  After the Early Adopter Phase, the aircraft will enter the continued maintenance phase where PMDG will shift focus away from developing new features and instead provide regular compatibility/stability updates, turning to the development of its next product - the 777 series for MSFS. Currently, PMDG has not yet announced a firm release date or pricing for the 737NG series. However the developers stressed that the Early Adopter phase will not affect the price of the aircraft. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, scenery developer Aviotek Simulation Software has published a short update on its upcoming Frankfurt Airport scenery for both X-Plane 11 and MSFS. The brief blog provides the community with a glimpse into the sceneryâs progress and showcases new previews. According to the developers, they are trying to âintegrate and include as many details as possible, as well as some unique features never seen beforeâ, a process that will âtake way longer than expected sometimesâ. Therefore, at the current stage, it is impossible to estimate how much longer the team needs to complete the airport. From the previews accompanying the post, it is clear that the modeling for the passenger and cargo terminals, towers, and hangers are mostly complete. A few ground vehicles ranging from buses to pushback trucks are also showcased. In a previous post, the developers has revealed that the scenery will come with high quality PBR textures and custom animations for both simulators, promising to provide in-sim previews as soon as possible. Currently, the developers are yet to announce a release date or pricing for Frankfurt Airport. Based on Aviotekâs previous products, the scenery will likely cost between $18 and $26 USD. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Scenery developer Verticalsim has released the highly anticipated Myrtle Beach (KYMR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. This scenery is not just the airport of the South Carolina city but it comes with the surrounding hotels too. Being used as an army base until 1948, the city of Myrtle Beach decided there was not a need for an airport in the area, though funds were allocated. With the land being annexed in 1977, the property was used as a join civil-military airport, though it severely limited the number of civilian flights. Years later in 1996, the airport gained international status with new terminals with an influence from the local beaches. The airport served over 2.4 million passengers in 2018, being the second busiest airport in South Carolina. The product comes with many features that portray the quality work of Verticalsim. Starting off, the 2022 layout of the airport is included along with proper taxi signage. Custom jetways compatible with the SAM plugin are also a part of this package.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Last week, aircraft developer Indiafoxtecho published a lengthy post on its Facebook page to announce new projects and bring development updates on existing ones. First off, the developers confirmed that their next project will be the Tornado for Microsoft Flight Simulators. Both the IDS and IDS-MLU will be developed, with the legacy IDS serving as the baseline model. Additionally, the developers hinted that âthe GR1, ECR and possibly the ADV variantâ will also be developed, though the feasibility of an ADV variant will be dependent on the resources available to the team.  A few previews depicting the planeâs Â exterior modeling were also published with the post, though the developers warned that they were taken at preliminary stages of development and will be drastically improved later on.  	In addition to announcing the Tornado, the Indiafoxtecho also touched on the progress of their other products. According to the developers, the Aermacchi M346, which will use native MSFS FCS flight model, now has a completed HTML5/JS HUD , but is experiencing slight delays in texturing and system programming. The aircraft should be ready for beta testing in the coming weeks. As for the Eurofighter Typhoon, the developers has decided to model the plane from scratch since they are not satisfied with the commercial meshes and P3D model they originally planned to use as a starting point, a process that will take considerably more time to complete. Finally, the developers talked about bringing the teamâs projects to DCS. They revealed that DCS development entails much more work than that for other simulators, requiring extensive planning and research beforehand. Therefore, their DCS team is currently only focused on âbringing the MB.339â to the market. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>
