    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Flyingron Simulations released its long-anticipated F6F Hellcat, adding to its ever-growing war-bird hangar. In WWII, the Grumman Hellcat served primarily as a NAVY bird on aircraft carriers. It replaced the F4F Wildcat to take on the A6M Zero. The Hellcat later became one of the top performing combat aircraft of the war gaining over 5,000 kills by the end of World War II. Flyingiron has brought the Hellcats legacy to Microsoft Flight Simulator with meticulous attention to detail. Flyingiron has also gained recognition for its Spitfire and P-58 models developed for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â The F6F-5 HELLCAT is for sale for the reasonable price of $45 AUD.  â The model is well detailed and handcrafted, taking over six months to complete. A few notable features include attention to aircraft systems and thermodynamics, factors to be considered in terms of wear and tear, and power plant management. Expect a learning curve when flying the Hellcat, which will challenge your manual flying skills. The F6F will be an exciting aircraft to switch to if you are used to flying today's modern birds. Usability features include a virtual tablet with customization options, maintenance, live aircraft monitoring, and more.Â  For a complete list of features including the product manual, check out the Hellcat product page here on the Flyingiron Simulations site. â</summary>

    <title>DC Designs Announce Harrier Update and Surprise Fighter Project</title>
    <updated>2022-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/dcdesh" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. DC Designs have posted a news update to their Facebook page detailing requested features from several customers. One such request from customers is if the Harrier could bow as it does in real-life air displays, as seen in this video. Here is the response. â Â âI had not had the chance to test this until recently, and yesterday was able to give it a go. The answer was: yes you can! However, to balance the Harrier while performing the bow and not climb, drift, or descend is really difficult even in light winds. The aircraftâs engine thrust responds to N2, which means there is a lag between adding or removing power, and the thrust altering to climb or descend in the hover, which complicates things even further.â Check out more test footage of the Harrier here. The developer also dropped hints of a "Secret projectâ within the post. Just today the project was announced via Facebook as a partnership with a new developer âCJ Simulations". The pair are working together in bringing the Eurofighter Typhoon to FS2020.Â  This will be a well detailed model with a fully operational cockpit. The Typhoon will have a custom flight model simulating its unique delta canard system. You can expect many liveries and visual aerodynamic effects to be featured with this fighter as well. DC Designs also released a video displaying the Typhoon's maneuverability, aerodynamic effects, and modeling details! The Eurofighter is slated to be released in October for PC and XBox. Weâre looking forward to these releases. DC Designs is known for their awesome fighter aircraft for FS2020, especially the F-14 Tomcat. Weâll keep you updated with more information here at Threshold! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The X-Crafts team has taken to their YouTube Channel and posted a full flight video in their rendition of the Embraer E-195 demonstrating the new FMS, new autopilot systems, and new displays. While most of the team has remained tight-lipped since the FSExpo Showcase, the team has brung steady work and the continuous development of their E-Jets Family.Â  The video starts off at LOWW and showcases the complete programming of the WIP FMC, and shows off the new EFB, with at a glance looks to include takeoff and landing perfs, checklists, ground service, and integrated Avitab, along with a weight and balance tab. Ending the video off, the demo ends with the programming once again of the FMC for landing at LYBE, and we watch as the aircraft comes to the gate and ends the flight. Note that this product is still very much a WIP. The team has stated that there will be a paid upgrade for XP12 for both the E175 and E195.Â  No ETA has been stated by the development team.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier today, Ben Supnik took to the X-Plane Developer blog to post about the current state and findings with X-Plane 12 since its initial early access release just two weeks ago. In the post Mr. Supnik highlights the rationale behind releasing X-Plane 12 for early access when the simulator is far from being fully developed, as there are â...still over two hundred open bugs.â Mr. Supnik immediately stressed how important it is to Laminar Research that the âentire X-Plane community be involved in X-Plane 12âs growth,â and not be confined to a limited number of beta testers.  Major areas of improvement include clouds, in which Mr. Supnik explains that the development team is working on shaping and cloud quality, improving resolution, correcting artifacts, and improving overall performance. The developer goes on to point out that clouds are some of the most taxing graphics on any system and itâs a âgive and takeâ relationship between performance and quality. Lighting is another focus of improvement for the developer as they want to correct and improve the auto-exposure and tone mapping within the sim.  For those X-Plane 12 users who are dissatisfied with the Boeing FMC in the highly anticipated Airbus A330 that shipped with the default aircraft upon initial release of X-Plane 12, youâll be happy to know that the developer is working on a proper Airbus MCDU for the plane. This update is expected to ship during early access, but with no specific mention of a date at this time. Mr. Supnik lastly points out that a few new SDK and authoring features are âmostly completedâ and will ship during early access as well. Mr. Supnik further hinted at allowing third party access to the in-sim weather system.  Additionally, the development team at Laminar will continue to optimize the simâs GPU usage while beginning to optimize VRAM use (as they have not done so at this point). For users of X-Plane 12 who are having VRAM issues, Mr. Supnik suggests lowering the simulator's resolution. Lastly, Mr. Supnik mentioned that over the course of the past weekend, some of the development team met to do planning and roadmapping for the sim. He disclosed that beta 3 should be coming out âshortlyâ (with no specific date or bug the planned update will fix). Mr. Supnik also disclosed that X-Plane 12 has been submitted to Steam and is currently in review. Heâs hopeful that X-Plane 12 will be available soon on the Steam platform for those interested in picking up the simulator there instead of through the developerâs site.  If you are interested in picking up X-Plane 12 now, you can do so by visiting the official website for X-Plane here. Threshold will keep you updated on any new developments.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Popular third party addon xOrganizer has officially been released for X-Plane 12 and is available now via the X-Plane.Org Store. xOrganizer is a third-party software that gives accessability and users a peace of mind when it comes to their files. While the structuring for X-Plane files can be simple, it can be challenging for new users to overcome that roadblock on their simulation journey. xOrganizer helps assist those users into structuring everything from the scenerypackages.ini file, to making sure all aircraft are up to do date. While it can keep the proper order of your scenery files, xOrganizer is also includes a scenery map, detailing where and what scenery packages you have installed and the package X-Plane is currently using. In a simple UI, it outlines plugins, aircraft, and scenery, and gives the option to the user whether or not they use the assistance of software. Customizablity is also added for the extra touch and accessablity for users. If you are interested in the full feature list, you can view it on their store page. If you interested in upgrading or purchasing this product for yourself, you can find it over at the X-Plane.Org Store. For v2 customers, check your account page and you'll see a discount code you can use at checkout.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. In a recent statement on the X-Pilot forums, IXEG developer Tom Kyler provided a brief insight into what the IXEG has been working on. In the post, Mr. Kyler alluded to the fact that his focus has been primarily on porting over the MU-2 into X-Plane 12 and that heâs closing in on the final stages of that. After the MU-2 project is completed, Mr. Kyler states that, â...the 733 will move back into rotation as the primary focus of development with the port to version 12 being the first priority.âÂ  Mr. Kyler continued to express that the IXEG 733 (in its current state), is âminimally operableâ in the updated simulator. Once the developer stabilizes the aircraft, Mr. Kyler expects they will set up a âvolunteer forumâ where people will be able to provide feedback to the developer regarding the behavior and bugs with the aircraft. Mr. Kyler also released a screenshot of the cockpit of the 733 in X-Plane 12. Concluding his statement, Mr. Kyler recommends keeping X-Plane 11 on your pc if you want to continue flying the IXEG aircraft in the interim.Â  As always, Threshold will keep you updated for any further updates from IXEG. </summary>
