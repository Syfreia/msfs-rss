    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Chios Island National Airport (LGHI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 16th busiest airport in Greece with a yearly average of 240,000 passengers. It serves Chios, the fifth-largest Greek island.  Owned by the government, Chios Airport started its operations in mid-1969 with an Olympic Airways flight from Athens. It underwent several upgrades, including a new passenger terminal in the 1980s. According to Greek Travel Pages, the airport recently received 9.6 million euros in funding from the National Strategic Reference Framework to upgrade the infrastructure and facilities, expanding the terminal to comport higher traffic figures. Deputy Minister Giorgios Karagiannis has mentioned itâs part of a broader plan to modernize the airports in the country.  With a single, 1,511-meter-long runway, it mostly gets regional traffic from either Olympic Air or Sky Expressâ ATR fleet, but it can fit up to an Airbus A320/ Boeing 738. The airlines mentioned above are the only ones currently serving the airport, with frequent flights to Athens, Thessaloniki, Lemnos, Mytilene, Rhodes, and Samos.Â   The scenery features hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation with custom ground decals, signposts, vegetation, parking barriers, and more, accurate real-world decals and advertisements, accurately placed lighting, surrounding objects including shops and boats, and hand-placed ground service equipment properly scattered around.Â   Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $8.58, requiring at least 1.84 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Yesterday, Chudoba Design made an announcement post on theirÂ Facebook pageÂ regarding their release of Gothenburg for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12 and a new project, temporarily named "Project People," bringing Inverse Kinematics animated 3D people into X-Plane.  The project will involve renting a motion capture studio for two weeks in April to capture a wide range of movements that can be used to create models of idle people, passengers, ramp agents, and more. These models will be imported into X-Plane as an extensive library, and the best part is that it will be free for users and freeware scenery creators. Payware scenery creators will only need to pay a small fee per airport that uses the library.Â   They have also mentioned the possibility of a potential MSFS conversion in the future "if everything goes well" while also reinforcing it's their biggest project to date.Â  â While the focus is currently on "Project People," Chudoba Design plans to bring more sceneries to X-Plane and convert some of their existing sceneries to MSFS. LBBG, HETB, and HEMM will be brought to MSFS, and they also plan to recreate some objects in LROP and completely recreate groundpoly in LKPR. With all these exciting developments, users can look forward to an even more immersive simulation experience with Chudoba Design.  There is no information on a potential release date, but the developer recommends keeping an eye on theirÂ DiscordÂ for further details.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SkyDesigners has recently released their rendition of the Cambrai-Ãpinoy Air Base (LFQI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a deactivated air base near Cambrai in France.  Created by the Germans during WW1, it was taken by the French air force right after the war, becoming âAir Base 103â (around 1936). It was once again occupied by the Germans during WW2, between 1940 and 1944, stationing several Luftwaffe units. The British took over briefly during the liberation of France, and it was handed back to the French in 1945.  It was renamed in 1959 after Commander RenÃ© Mouchotte, who died fighting for France in 1944.  The air base was officially closed in 2013, after many years of history and two world wars, bolstering over 1,500 personnel during its glory days.Â   In April 2017, the site was purchased. It will undergo a conversion process to become the largest e-Commerce warehouse in Europe, with 700,000 square meters of built area, costing around 300 million euros to make, and potentially generating 1,300 jobs, heavily benefitting the region: the unemployment rate at Cambrai sits at 24% (as of 2017).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the air base as it was before its conversion into a warehouse, with multiple static aircraft (Mirage 2000C, 2000Bs, with their real numbers and registrations), maintenance zones and hangars as of 2010, specific service vehicles and ground crew, photorealistic buildings, accurate modeling of military installations and their squadrons, hundreds of custom objects, MIAC charts for the corresponding period, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.12, requiring at least 766.13 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Orbx Releases Rockhampton Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/orbroc" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Rockhampton Airport (YBRK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a major Australian regional airport serving the city of Rockhampton. Itâs the 17th busiest airport in the country, with a yearly average of 634,913 passengers (as of 2014-2015).  The airport opened in March 1930 as Rockhampton Aero Club flying field after many years of collective effort to find a suitable site in the city to build an aerodrome. It was built on top of a former racecourse, Connor Park, acquired by some aspiring aviators and adapted for airplanes. The first passenger aircraft to touch Rockhamptonâs runway was a Fokker monoplane during the opening ceremony.Â   Between 1938 and 2021, Rockhampton Airport hosted a meteorological office providing proper weather observation for airplanes and general purposes. It was closed two years ago after generating a lot of discussion between the locals.  The airport saw its first upgrades during World War 2, with its total land size doubling, and a new 1,250-yard bitumen runway was built to reduce the dust being stirred up by the propellers and causing discomfort to passengers and interfering with the meteorological station. The Australian Royal Air Force moved in shortly after, establishing an Aeradio station that survived until 1992.Â   Due to its proximity to the Fitzroy River, the airport is prone to closures when the river floods, which caused it to close many times over in 1954, 1991, 2011, and 2017, which eventually prompted a proposal to relocate the airport.Â   Rockhampton was redeveloped in 2008 at the cost of 8 million Australian dollars, which included a complete renovation of the terminal, removing an old viewing deck, a new cafÃ©/restaurant, relocation of offices and check-in counters, and a customs screening point for international flights, along with new air conditioning equipment and improved lighting.Â   Recently, the airport saw a new upgrade, with a 41 million dollar refurbishment that included new body scanners and body screening equipment, private airline lounges, a FIFO hub, additional retail and hospitality businesses, and a slight update on existing amenities. Work progressed further than expected because it coincided with the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.  Itâs currently served by four airlines: Bonza (Sunshine Coast, Townsville), QantasLink (Brisbane, Cairns, Mackay, Townsville), Skytrans Airlines (Cairns and Proserpine), and Virgin Australia (Brisbane).  The scenery features a detailed rendition of Rockhampton Airport with ultra-high-resolution textures, custom groundpoly, taxiway lighting, military and GA static aircraft, interior terminal modeling of the departure area, terraformed runways, drainage channels, taxiways, and aprons, and crisp 15cm aerial imagery.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.39, requiring at least 1.17 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Microsoft has released sim update 12. This update includes multiple bug fixes as well as some new features. Big features include WASM support for Xbox usersÂ and new controls for turbulence. The biggest release as a part of this update is WASM support. WASM is the core script to Microsoft Flight Simulator and is attributed to the lack of support for addons in the Xbox edition. With this script being added to the Xbox edition, we will begin to see add-ons that were only available for PC move into the Xbox edition.Â  Along with the WASM support, numerous general fixes were made, and several improvements were also made to the navigation/ traffic system. Live weather also received a big update with new controls for turbulence. The Garmin G3000 and G5000 systems received updates to improve functionality and accuracy.Â  Â Finally, several aircraft received fixes and improvements, with the A310, Cessna Citation Longitude, and the Cessna Citation CJ4 receiving the most updates.Â  â For a full list of improvements and more information on how to install this update, please visit the Microsoft Flight Simulator Forum for more details.Â  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Token Design has recently released their rendition of Vernon Regional Airport (CYVK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a non-towered airport serving the city of Vernon, in Canada.  The origin of the airport dates back to the end of WW2 when Vernon relocated their airfield from the south of the city to the farmlands of Okanagan Landing, where it initially sported a single grass field that is half todayâs length. For 20 years, the Vernon Flying Club was the sole tenant - with four aircraft - and responsible for paving the 1,200x12 runway with two inches of asphalt.  During the early 1950s, Vernon Regional got a hangar, which progressively increased the aircraft capacity and traffic at the airport, with up to eighty airplanes at one point, 20 years later down the road. Such extra traffic motivated a new runway expansion to 2,200 feet while keeping the same width.Â   For over 18 years, the airport remained unchanged until the late 1980s when The Vernon Flying Club and the Tri-Lake Flight Centre financed the construction of a new runway.Â   Itâs an important airport in the region for skydivers, as it happens to be the only airport in the Okanagan Valley that allows it, given all commercial operators have to provide written consent to the skydiving company that desires to offer such service, which makes it rather unfeasible on bigger and busier airports.  The scenery features over 30 hand-modeled 3D buildings throughout the airport, an accurate replica of the main airport building terminal, the Okanagan College Aerospace Campus hangar, a custom runway with correct aprons &amp; night lighting, multiple static aircraft parked at the right areas, hand-modeled &amp; textured fuel tanks, custom taxiway signs, 4K high-detail PBR textures, and the CYVK rose compass texture on the ground.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.25, requiring at least 198.61 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

PMDG has announced that both the 737 and DC-6 will become available on the Xbox platform soon.Â  PMDG has been able to accomplish this through the implementation of C++/WASM for Xbox. Many developers such as PMDG rely on this script for their aircraft to function, with the addition of this script to Xbox will allow developers to release aircraft for both platforms.Â  This update is a major improvement to conforming both platforms, PMDG has finalized updates for the DC-6 and expects it to become available on March 30th with the 737 expected to be complete by the end of April.Â  More information about the update can be found at the PMDG Forum, ad the updates will be available through the in-game marketplace.
