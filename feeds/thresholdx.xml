    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Developer Antâs Airplanes has just released their latest product for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the CAC CA-25 Winjeel. This is Antâs third aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator, following the Tiger Moth, and the Ultralight Drifter. Antâs also have a history of developing aircraft for FSX and P3D, and they also develop freeware for all three simulators. The CA-25 is a fixed wing, three seat, piston-driven taildragger and it was designed and built by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in Australia. It was developed exclusively for the Royal Australian Air Force and it was used as their main training aircraft for four decades. The first CA-25 flew in 1955, and deliveries started later that same year. In total, 62 Winjeels were produced, and there are only 30 airworthy aircraft left today, with most being privately owned. The Antâs Airplanes rendition of the CA-25 is based on a 1956 airframe, registered VH-OPJ, and has been modified to have an extra seat, bringing the total to 4 seats. Some of the features of the Antâs CA-25 include: For more information and videos on the Antâs Airplanes CA-25 Winjeel, you can head to their website. You can pick up the Winjeel at Simmarket, with availability on the Just Flight store coming soon as of the time of writing for $17.95 USD.  â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news and reviews on the latest in flight simulation!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Skyline Simulations has recently released their rendition of Queen Tamar Airport (UGSM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Mestia in Georgia, with a yearly average of 9,300 passengers as of 2022.  Mestia Airport was part of Georgiaâs plan to increase regional tourist figures. It was built in 2010 with a GEL 8 million investment, with an architectural project that boasts a modern glassy style that contrasts with the natural surroundings and does not impact the environment. Designed and created by Jurgen Mayer-Hermann, the BBC considers the airport one of the worldâs most beautiful.Â   With a 1,158-meter runway at 1,456 meters above sea level, the range of aircraft that can fly into this airport is limited. Itâs currently only served by Vanilla Sky with their Let L-410 UVP-Es, taking passengers to Kutaisi, where passengers can connect with the rest of Europe.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR materials, custom ground textures, custom 3D vegetation, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.68, requiring at least 644.37 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Drzewiecki Designs has recently released his latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator, being KBFI Boeing Field in Seattle. This is Drzewieckiâs third Seattle-area scenery, following the release of Paine Field and Renton. All three of these airports serve as sites for production or delivery of Boeingâs lines of aircraft.  Boeing Field, officially known as King County International Airport, is situated five miles south of downtown Seattle. It served as Seattleâs main passenger gateway, until the larger Seattle-Tacoma Airport opened in 1944. It was crucial in the production of many early 737 series of aircraft in the 1960âs, due to the fact that Boeingâs other narrowbody production facility at Renton didnât have enough capacity. Today, it mainly serves as a cargo airport, and is the site of the Boeing Delivery Center, where new 737âs are delivered after going through final preparation. The Drzewiecki Designs rendition of the airport has many features, including: As of the time of writing, you can get this airport on the Aerosoft store, but that will expand to other vendors shortly. â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news and reviews on the latest in flight simulation!</summary>

Randazzo says that we shouldnât expect much yet, but more previews will be coming.  â Also in this development update are updates on progress about the Marketplace, and updates to the Universal Flight Tablet Concerning the Marketplace, for PC, Randazzo tells us that the new updates will be coming, and it is only a matter of time before Microsoft approves the update and pushes it to the public. On the Xbox side of things, Randazzo says that they âcontinue to work on the testing and trouble-shooting tools that we need in order to collect sufficient data to demonstrate to the platform developer that the communications layer for C++/WASM airplanes is partially or fully inoperative on the Xbox platform.â He continues on to tell us that âWe are working to find a way to disable the broken tablet functionality when running on Xbox so that we can at least keep Xbox users up-to-date with any other improvements and non-tablet changes that we make.â There also is a new update to the PMDG Universal Flight Tablet, which Mr. Randazzo says will be the final one for 2023. The full changelog follows below: 12817: [EFB - Navigraph Charting Functions] Navigraph map-type choice (IFR low/high/etc.) should be persistent (rmurdoch) 12610: [EFB - Navigraph Charting Functions] Save users pref of aircraft symbol in settings (rmurdoch) 12832: [EFB - Performance and Computational] New menu data for 777 (cbpowell) 12635: [EFB - General] Day/Night should default to most applicable and allow over selection please (rmurdoch) 12831: [EFB - General] Make signal bar reflect currency of airplane pings (rmurdoch) 12569: [EFB - General] Utilize MSFS built-in airport data for OPT (rmurdoch) â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news and reviews on the latest in flight simulation!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cockspur, known for their Cessna C162 and C510 Mustang, have previewed their upcoming Embraer Phenom 100. Originally announced earlier in December, there hasnât been much information about the upcoming release. The Embraer Phenom 100 is a very light business jet that made its first flight in 2007. The powerplant of the Phenom 100 (EMB-500) is two Pratt and Whitney PW600 turbofan engines providing almost 4,000 lbf of thrust combined. Requiring only one pilot the Phenom 100 has room for up to 5 passengers depending on the configuration. With a service ceiling of 41,000 ft and a cruise speed of 400 knots, the Phenom 100 has a maximum range of 1,178 nmi. In the post on their Facebook page, Cockspur has provided several screenshots of the exterior of the plane. While there havenât been any previews of the interior so far it looks as though Cockspur have provided excellent exterior modelling and impressive texturing. Thereâs currently no indication of when we could see a release of the aircraft or at what price point. For all of your flight simulation news updates be sure to stay tuned to Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Golden Key Studio has unveiled their latest project, the development of the F-111 for MSFS, following their previous release of the MiG-21Bis Fishbed. The announcement was made via the flight simulator forums today. The Aardvark, an aircraft of the 1960s, was manufactured by General Dynamics and stands as a supersonic-capable medium-range multirole aircraft. It served various roles, excelling as an attack aircraft, bomber, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare platform. Primarily operated by the US Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force, this aircraft witnessed over 500 units produced across six distinct variants. GKS has dedicated its efforts to the F-111E variant, powered by Pratt and Whitney's TF-30 engines that enable the F-111 to achieve speeds of up to Mach 2.5. Streamlining its high-speed capabilities is a swing-wing design reminiscent of the F-14 Tomcat. GKS has offered a sneak peek into the intricate details of the cockpit, ensuring a well-detailed version of its unique side-by-side seating cockpit. Judging by the screenshots shared by GKS, the exterior model appears to be nearing completion and or completed. While GKS has provided sparse details regarding pricing and release dates, we can anticipate additional information in the near future. Stay tuned to Threshold for updates on this exciting addition to the MSFS lineup.</summary>
