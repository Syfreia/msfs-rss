    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After entering beta in early February, the Fenix Simulations team has returned to keeping their lips tight. Aamir has since returned from the depths of silence to share a singular new screenshot of the upcoming A320 for MSFS. The screenshot showcases the functionality of the EFB, as well as shows the cockpit in a âturnaroundâ state. Aamir hasn't mentioned any additional details regarding the aircraft's progress in beta but did claim that an upcoming update will reveal "areas of the products as yet unseen/unheard!." For those who aren't familiar with the current functionality of the aircraft, you should gaze at Fenix's YouTube channel that exhibits the A320's components. The team also has a public Discord server where members can communicate with any inquiries or concerns.Â  Unfortunately, there isn't much more to share with this update, but Threshold will keep up to date with Fenix as more information is released shortly.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Smooth seas donât make skillful sailors, Wellington International Airport is testament to this. Located just outside of the world's windiest city, this airport has notoriously had pilots constantly on their toes and challenging their skills. Windy Welly has since its inception, had pilots and seatbelts alike tested everyday, with a relatively short runway not making things any easier. That said, you canât beat Wellington on a good day! FlightBeam Studios have been hard at work to give us the opportunity to experience this airport first-hand, recently sharing a couple of preview images that evidently suggest that this project is indeed in its late phase of production. The textures are clear and complete with buildings looking true to reality. Unlike most sceneries, surroundings are particularly important here as your nose will almost never be straight down the centerline.Â  The precise attention to detail in the air bridge texturing in particular, demonstrates the teams capabilities, setting our expectations high as we hope this level of detail remains consistent throughout the scenery as a whole. We can confirm release is imminent as FlightBeam Studios have opened applications for Beta testers whom must meet the following prerequisites, as mentioned on their official application form:Â  For more information stay tuned. Do feel free to check out their original preview post. Should you be interested in beta testing and meet the above requirements, submit an application here.Â Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Throughout the years, Aerobask has played a critical role in X-Planeâs 3rd Party Addons. Providing quality, detailed, and outstanding-looking aircraft for the simulator. Today, Aerobask and X-Plane.org have released a trailer for the upcoming DA50 aircraft, coming to XP11 and XP12. Being one of Aerobaskâs more highly anticipated General Aviation aircraft, the trailer provides a good look into what will be included in the aircraft when it is released. At first glance, the exterior of the aircraft is modeled correctly to match its real-world counterpart. With all exterior lighting, and features such as the winglets, being modeled as well. The shots of the interior of the aircraft provide us with a look at the G1000 suite that comes with all Aerobask products alongside the standard cockpit of all Diamond aircraft. Interior lighting has been accurately placed, along with seats, air vents, and other miscellaneous aspects of the cockpit being modeled correctly as well. While no feature list has been provided as of yet, Aerobaskâs reputation as a developer has reached all ends of the market, both freeware and payware. Users are looking forward to being able to test this product in X-Plane 12, which Aerobask has stated this product along with other products will be compatible with the next-generation simulator. â No official date for release has been brought to light, but Threshold will be sure to keep you updated on any further developments.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. VATSIM's team has announced the opening of their slot system for pilots to express their interest in participating in the upcoming event. Those who aren't familiar with the new slot system should note that the new system doesn't allow you to book a specific slot initially, but rather "expressing interest" enters you into a lottery to win a slot.  âCross The Pond is the largest and longest-running event on VATSIM. Its history dates back to almost 20 years ago, and the event takes place biannually in a transatlantic fashion between North America and Europe. The VATSIM team has adapted to the modern media landscape, so pilots can now monitor CTP updates by following the #CTP22W hashtag on Twitter rather than having to scour through the website. They've also created a Discord server for aspiring CTP pilots to communicate and receive news regarding the event.  Lastly, the team wants to thank the community for its dedicated volunteers for making the event possible. Pilots who desire to participate should check out their website to potentially win a spot for the event.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDGÂ has entered its fourth week of testingÂ their upcoming 737-700 for MSFS. As reported in weeks past, the team is making better-than-anticipated progress on the aircraft. Hundreds of "taskings," also known as "bug reports," have been resolved since the beginning of the beta test.Â  Randazzo reports that the "number of knee-knockers we are hitting that are related to PMDG-platform interface issues is dropping rapidly, and the number of "this system/function is behaving incorrectly" reports is rising as a percentage of the whole." Systems-wise, the airplane is operating at an "expected level" in this development phase.Â  PMDG is simultaneously working on improving the visuals of the aircraft, such as adding more wear-and-tear to the cockpit and adding some more character to the textures. Randazzo noted some small yet crucial details of their texturing adventures, relating to aluminum being exposed on the backing plate for the right-most dimmer panel, left of the captain's FMS. Aesthetic fingerprints are also being incorporated onto the screens of the digital displays. Last but not least, PMDG will begin working on some other preview videos as some time is freeing up to allow them to do so. No additional information regarding the aircraft was shared, but keep up with Threshold to stay in touch with the latest and greatest from PMDG!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After releasing a multitude of freeware projects, GotFriends have once again decided to venture into the world of payware, with the announcement of the EA7 Optica, their second payware aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This aircraft is a full remaster of the previous freeware version which released last year. The developer has made it clear, however, that this is built completely from the ground up and includes exciting features such as a KAP140 autopilot and full PMS50 (GTN750) support. Included are âseveral real world liveries the aircraft was most popular for,â an animated cat and dog sitting visibly in the cockpit, and the aforementioned KAP140 autopilot and GTN750 support. It should be noted, however, that currently the TDS GTN750 does not work with this aircraft. Upon its initial release, the aircraft is set to be exclusive to the Flightsim.to store, and will be coming to the MSFS Marketplace (and Xbox) within a month. Furthermore, the aircraft is set to cost $19.99, but will launch with a sale of 50% as a token of appreciation to the community. It was also stated that users should be looking forward to the aircraft releasing sometime next week. For further information make sure to check out the official teaser trailer, as well as the original announcement made on the Flightsim.to website</summary>

    <title>X-Scenery Announces Mitsubishi MU-2B-60 Marquise 2.0</title>
    <updated>2022-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, X-Plane developer X-Scenery officially announced their latest project - the Mitsubishi MU-2B-60 Marquise 2.0. The aircraft, a completely reinvented version of the developerâs first payware product back in 2008, will serve as nostalgia for longtime X-Plane users while allowing others to enjoy a memorable general aviation experience. According to the developer, the 3D model of the MU-2 has to be redone from the ground up to accommodate for the differences between X-Plane 9, the simulator the first version of the plane was designed for, and X-Plane 11. Improved software technology, hardware capabilities, and workflow have allowed the team to improve the modelâs geometric fidelity and âget the challenging shapes and curves more accurateâ. To illustrate the differences between the two models, the developers included a comparison between the two where the v2 model clearly has âa higher density 3D model all aroundâ. Additionally, higher 3D details have been utilized in certain areas of the aircraft to âreflect light more realistically as [the user] moves the camera aroundâ, an approach that differs from the traditional method of using texture decals which may result in âfake looking 3D modelsâ. To compliment the new model, the developers are also utilizing PBR textures with a solid implementation of ambient occlusion, âa phenomenon where light loses energy as it bounces around into corners, resulting in darker corners and recessesâ. Since ambient occlusion is not provided for aircraft in X-Plane by default, it will be painted, or "baked", into the MU-2's textures. For a full list of improvements in version 2, checkout the developer's post. Finally, the developers teased that additional progress updates that will introduce the users to the MU-2âs cockpit will be published soon, though no specific time frames has been given. Currently, X-Scenery is yet to announce the release date or pricing of the Mitsubishi MU-2. However, the developers did indicate owners of V1 will receive a discount when purchasing MU-2 V2. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. </summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes Update on 737-700</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, aircraft developer PMDG has published a new update on its much anticipated 737-700 project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, discussing the status of the aircraftâs testing, developmental progress, and upcoming plans. According to the developers, the testing of the aircraft continues smoothly, with some 70 issues reported by the testers and more than 120 solved by the development team. However, despite the 737 currently performing at a near satisfactory level, the developers expressed their frustration that MSFS currently lacks âtools that [they] would normally use to improve code stability and look for areas that require optimizationâ, preventing them from gaining vital insights on key areas needing improvements. In addition to updates on testing, the team also shined light on their current task of improving the details of some areas âto evaluate the impact different techniques may have on the performance of the simulatorâ. The developers are trying to gradually increase the level of details without sacrificing any performance, a process aided by their âincreased confidence in Asobo's rendering engineâ.Â The developer's progress is demonstrated by the completely rebuilt fire handles and light knobs pictured above. Finally, the developers revealed that a âfull bore promotional processâ will soon start, presenting the public with additional details on the aircraft and answering their questions. Currently, PMDG has not revealed the release date of the aircraft, claiming that its carefully designed workflow and testing procedure currently prevent it from determining a precise date. However, the developers teased that the 737 is âvery close to that pointâ where a firm release date can be set and the embargo can be lifted for beta testers. â</summary>
