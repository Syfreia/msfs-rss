    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx hasÂ recently announcedÂ the development of two general aviation airfields, minutes apart from each other: S43 Harvey Field &amp; W16 Monroe First Air Field, both in Washington, United States.  Harvey Airfield is a privately-owned public-use airport in Sonomish (WA), categorized on the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems as a regional reliever facility. It was established in 1944 by the Harvey Family, getting a restaurant, an administration building, and a maintenance shop in 1947.Â   It is mainly used for flight training in general aviation airplanes and helicopters but also offers fuel and aircraft maintenance.  Monroe First Air Field is a public-use airport owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation. It opened in 1930 as a private airfield for Monroe Aircraft Corporation and was utilized in the following decade as a training base for the US Army.Â   The post-war saw the airfield become a general aviation facility, which continues to this day, even after its acquisition by the Washington State Department of Transportation in 1980.  Despite being small, it's considered a very important part of the state's history for its many purposes over its nearly 100 years of existence. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of both airfields, with custom dynamic lighting, full PBR 4K texturing, photo-realistic textures created with on-site photography, and more. â There is no release date or pricing information.

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Grinelli Designs has recently published a new development update on their upcoming F-100D Super Sabre Module for DCS concerning its current 3D modeling progress, sound design, and future development plans.Â   They have used advanced 3D scanning techniques and photogrammetry to obtain precise measurements, shapes, and textures of the exterior and cockpit, which were then sent to their modeling team to be used as a reference for their work.  Grinelli Designs has also recorded many cockpit sounds to enhance the productâs audio experience.  The current development progress is said to be steadily moving forward, with the airplane in a flyable state and with many advancements in the flight model, engine, fuel, and hydraulic systems, while also actively testing and refining the core systems of the aircraft.  Even though the addition of the 3D scans has improved the accuracy and fidelity of their upcoming product, they claim thereâs more work to be done: continuous refinement of the exterior and interior, flight model tweaks, the implementation of a weapon system, and adding more liveries and customization options. They also claim they have been collaborating with real-world F-100D pilots and experts and actively listening to their insights and knowledge.  They finish the development update with a link to theirÂ progress tracker, where people can see how far they have come with the development so far.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimWorks Studios has published a development update on their upcoming Pilatus PC-12 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator.  The update previews multiple features that will be included with the plane, as well as a tentative release window for the highly anticipated aircraft.  â SWS reports that the executive cabin for the aircraft is now fully functional, with realistic cabin, flood, and reading lights being implemented. All the tray tables, seats, and armrests are also fully modeled and the drawers will close if the aircraft is banked too much. For the exterior, the update details that engine covers that are in addition to the Angle of Attack and pitot vane covers. Along with that, the "Remove Before Flight" tags on the covers will react to external forces such as aircraft slope, through a simulated gravity vector, and react to wind direction and speed.  â The aircraft is around two weeks from completion, and if all goes well, SimWorks Studios plans to send it to Pilatus to verify that that the aircraft's systems and flight model act just like the real aircraft.  â The team says that they are planning a mid-September release, as they are taking a two week break from August 14th through the 25th, and they want to give enough time to fix any bugs that their testing team, or Pilatus might find. As with many projects, this release window is subject to change. Whenever the release date is, Threshold will keep you updated, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released their rendition of MontrÃ©al-Trudeau International Airport (CYUL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving greater Montreal and eastern Ontario with a yearly average of 16 million passengers.  It opened in 1941, replacing Saint-Hubert Airport - Montrealâs former airport - considered inadequate for the cityâs needs into the 40s and beyond. It was constructed on land that once was a race track, chosen for its size and generally good weather conditions throughout the year. It also doubled as a military airport for almost twenty years.  In the 70s, the government planned on replacing it with a new, much larger airport - Montreal Mirabel -, then the largest in the world, repurposing YUL as a domestic airport. The whole project was centered around traffic growth that never happened for many reasons, which consequently caused the decline of both Montreal airports over the following decades.  The inconvenience of Mirabel grew larger and larger, to the point they decided to resume international operations in Montreal-Trudeau again in 1997 and charter flights in 2004 (and Mirabel ceased passenger operations entirely in 2004).Â   Itâs a hub for Air Canada (Barcelona, BogotÃ¡, Brussels, Calgary, Casablanca, Delhi, Denver, Edmonton, Fort-de-France, Frankfurt, Geneva, Halifax, HoustonâIntercontinental, Lisbon, LondonâHeathrow, Los Angeles, Lyon, Mexico City, Miami, MilanâMalpensa, ParisâCharles de Gaulle, Pointe-Ã -Pitre, Providenciales, RomeâFiumicino, San Francisco, San JosÃ© de Costa RicaâJuan SantamarÃ­a, SÃ£o PauloâGuarulhos, Tampa, TokyoâNarita, TorontoâPearson, Toulouse, Vancouver, Winnipeg), Air Transat (CancÃºn, Cayo Coco, Fort Lauderdale, HolguÃ­n, Lisbon, LondonâGatwick, Lyon, MÃ¡laga, Marseille, Miami, Montego Bay, Orlando, ParisâCharles de Gaulle, Port-au-Prince, Puerto Plata, Puerto Vallarta, Punta Cana, SamanÃ¡, Santa Clara, TorontoâPearson, Varadero), and OWG (Cayo Coco, HolguÃ­n, Santa Clara, Varadero), flying passengers all over the globe.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with LiDAR airport elevation data, custom satellite imagery covering the airport and its surroundings, custom ground polygons, handcrafted 3D models of buildings, jetways, and facilities, realistic night lighting, and more.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $18.70, requiring at least 5.09 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier, developer Orbx has announced on their social media platforms that they will be bringing their London City (EGLC) scenery to X-Plane 12.  London City Airport is located 6 miles east of the city of London in the Borough of Newham and sees on average 4 million passengers each year. The airport features just one runway, which also acts as the main taxiway. The short runway, steep approach angles, and strict noise abatement rules mean that the list of aircraft that service the airport is quite limited. Currently, the airport has flights offered by British Airways, ITA Airways, KLM, Loganair, LOT, Lufthansa, Luxair, and Swiss International.  Orbx included preview images of the scenery that highlighted the airportâs terminal and some recognisable buildings that can be seen around the airport. Orbx originally released the current version of EGLC for Microsoft Flight Simulator earlier this year. While no release date has been announced be sure to keep an eye on Threshold for any updates that may come.</summary>

Additionally, partnerships with Rainier Flight Service will provide the liveries of their entire fleet of 12 162s as defaults within the package. The 162 Skycatcher package will offer two variants - with or without wheel fairings - providing flexibility to pilots. Priced at $19.99, this aircraft will be accessible on both PC and Xbox platforms.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Parallel42 has announced the release of Bluffers Hill after seeing the popularity of Sharktooth Ridge. Bluffers Hill is located near Red Bluff, CA and is completely surrounded by bluffs and nearby sandbars. Parallel42 has used a 3D library of ground assets along with their own custom terraforming which overwrites the default MSFS terrain which in turn produces a better more realistic terrain for pilots. Bluffers Hill dares pilots to attempt its challenging approach, dangerous sloped runway and no safe option for a go-around. This brings a challenge to even the best pilots out there. Bluffers Hill is suited best to STOLÂ aircraft and any bush planes you have in your hangar. Included is a whole host of features which really bring this area to life when you fly here.  As always, Threshold will keep you informed with the latest news in Flight Simulation, stay tuned for more ! â</summary>
