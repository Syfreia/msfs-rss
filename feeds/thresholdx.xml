    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, developer SimWorks has published a Facebook post detailing the groupâs progress on their much anticipated PC-12 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, providing updates on the aircraftâs avionics, interior modeling, and lighting. According to SimWorks, the team has completed the PC-12âs electrical systems, a major milestone in the plane development. They are currently working on integrating the system with the various cockpit instruments. In addition, progress is being made on the planeâs avionics where the EADI has been finished while the finishing touches are being put on the EHSI.  As for the modeling and lighting, the developer claims that the interior design of the plane is 90%, with night lighting being gradually implemented into the cabin and cockpit. Finally, the exterior lighting of the PC-12 is now fully functional, though âa couple of quirksâ still needs to be fixed, Currently, the developers have not provided a firm release date for the airplane, nor have they disclosed the PC-12âs expected price. Threshold will keep you updated on this front â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MXI Design has recently released their rendition of Deauville-Normandie Airport (LFRG) Â for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the commune of Deauville in France with a yearly average of 160,000 passengers.  Inaugurated in 1931 by the initiative of EugÃ¨ne Collas (the mayor of Deauville back then), it initially served as a business airport, eventually opening up for tourist charter flights as time went by.  For a short while, it used to be considered a third airport for Paris, but the distance (two-hour drive) and the lack of transportation options made it unfeasible, and they quickly ruled it out.  In 1952, they built a cement runway, allowing it to handle more aircraft types. Seven years later, a control tower was built, along with a runway extension to 1,600 meters in 1961.  In 1971, a passenger terminal was inaugurated, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and making it more suitable for commercial flights.Â   Recently, the operator has decided to build a new terminal, scheduled to reach completion in late 2023, expanding its area from 1,750 to 3,800 square meters. The state will cover 95% of the total cost; the remainder will come from Deauville. They also intend to add a photovoltaic park nearby to reach completion between 2024-2027. â It's served on a seasonal basis by Aegean Airlines and Volotea. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detailed PBR models of the terminals and their respective interiors (built with performance in mind), custom taxiway signs, 3D passengers, custom ground textures, and custom night lighting.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.77, requiring at least 543.61 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BEAUTIFUL MODEL of the World and AmSim teamed up again to build a rendition of Daytona Beach International Airport (KDAB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, known for headquartering the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.  Daytona Beach was built in the 1930s on a 299-ha piece of land featuring two grass runways. Passenger service started in the same decade with Eastern Air Lines, followed by National Airlines a year later.Â   A little before World War 2, the airport got four paved runways, allowing for the operation of DC-2s and DC-3s. WW2 had the airport taken over by the US Navy, becoming the Naval Air Station Daytona Beach, followed by an extensive military construction effort. Many of the buildings were utilized by Embry-Riddle University after their move from Miami two decades later.  In 1992, a large terminal was built, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and transforming the old terminal into an international passenger terminal, followed by a final runway extension that sticks to this day.Â   As of mid-late 2021, the airport had 364,071 aircraft operations, with 62% corresponding to general aviation. The passenger figures sit at an average of 800,000 per year.Â   Itâs served by American Airlines (Charlotte), American Eagle (Charlotte), Avelo Airlines (to begin in June 2023), and Delta Air Lines (Atlanta).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings, high-resolution ground textures, landside buildings, a detailed terminal interior, and compatibility with FSLTL traffic.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $18.26, requiring at least 2.75 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to mtn_dude_ for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently announced their next project for X-Plane 11 and 12: a rendition of Faro International Airport (LPFR), serving the city of Faro in Algarve, Portugal, with a yearly average of 8 million passengers. It was inaugurated in 1965 by then president AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s, with a government-owned DC-3 being the first airplane ever to touch its runway, followed by TAP Air Portugalâs Lockheed Super Constellation, transporting government officials and important guests. Scheduled passenger service started two days after, connecting Faro to Lisbon. In that same year, the airport recorded 58,000 passengers. Faro has only seen two significant developments in its first 40 years: a new passenger terminal building in 1989, and its eventual enlargement in 2001, to cope with the increased demands for air travel. The 2010s brought even more pressure for expansion, which reached completion in 2013 after a two-phase work, increasing its passenger handling capacity from six million to eight million passengers. Minor expansion work went on over the remainder of the decade, with the airport now able to handle up to 9 million passengers a year, with 22 stands and 36 boarding gates.  Itâs a base for EasyJet and Ryanair, flying to many European destinations. The visitorsâ list includes many traditional European airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Scandinavian, and TAP Air Portugal and popular low-cost carriers such as Condor, Eurowings, Jet2, Smartwings, and Wizz Air. Thereâs no release date or pricing information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Melbourne Airport (YMML) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Melbourne in Australia with a yearly average of 25 million passengers. It is the second busiest airport in the country!  Built in the 60s and opened in 1970, it replaces Essendon Airport (Orbxâs home) as the cityâs main airport due to its relatively short runways, small terminals, and its expansion limitations that were a consequence of the urban development around the area.Â   During its first year of operations, Melbourne only handled international traffic, handling 155,275 international passengers that year and six airlines.Â   It originally featured three connected terminals, an international at the center, a terminal for Ansett to the south, and one for Trans Australia Airlines to the north. It could withstand 8 Boeing 707s and a rate of 500 passengers per hour, with expansion work three years later to comport the Boeing 747.  It wasnât long until the passenger figures increased drastically, forcing further expansion: the Ansett terminal, domestic, got bigger, followed by an upgrade to the international terminal in 1993 and the opening of a new three-level concourse in 1995, with ten additional jetways.  In 1997, Melbourne was privatized, on a 50-year long-term lease, followed by a series of upgrades and improvements, including the construction of a multi-story carpark with 3,100 parking spaces, a 276-room hotel, and the expansion of the Qantas domestic terminal with a second pier and nine additional stands.  In 2005, the airport underwent more construction work to become A380-ready, with a runway widening, the addition of dual jetbridges, a terminal extension, and a subsequent expansion of terminal 2 in 2006 and 2008, massively increasing its passenger handling capabilities.  The airport has 68 gates, 53 used for domestic operations and 15 for international.Â   The airport is a hub for Jetstar (Adelaide, Auckland, Ayers Rock, Ballina, BangkokâSuvarnabhumi, Brisbane, Busselton, Cairns, Canberra, Christchurch, Darwin, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Hobart, Ho Chi Minh City, Honolulu, Launceston, Newcastle, Perth, Phuket, Proserpine, Queenstown, Singapore, Sunshine Coast, Sydney, Townsville), Qantas (Adelaide, Alice Springs, Auckland, Ballina, Brisbane, Broome, Cairns, Canberra, Christchurch, Dallas/Fort Worth, Darwin, Delhi, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Â Hamilton Island, Hobart, Hong Kong, JakartaâSoekarno-Hatta, LondonâHeathrow, Los Angeles, Perth, Queenstown, Singapore, Sunshine Coast, Sydney, Wellington), Rex Airlines (Adelaide, Brisbane, Burnie, Canberra, Devonport, Gold Coast, King Island, Merimbula, Mildura, Mount Gambier, Sydney, Wagga Wagga), and Virgin Australia (Adelaide, Ballina, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, Darwin, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Hobart, Launceston, Nadi, Newcastle, Perth, Queenstown, Sunshine Coast, Sydney). The visitor list includes Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, LATAM Chile, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, and more.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, PBR texturing, interior terminal modeling of departure lounges, VDGS, custom traffic animations, crisp satellite imagery, custom ground clutter, custom POIs, LOD optimization, and a custom GSX profile.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $23.92, requiring at least 6.77 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Developer Simworks Studios, renowned for their rendition of the Kodiak 100 for MSFS has recently provided a development update on their Discord and Facebook regarding the RV-10/14, Okavango delta, and their PC-12. â In light of the recent Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 announcement, SimWorks Studios has stated that as their existing add-ons follow the guidelines of the MSFS SDK, they believe that they will work fine in FS2024. They will update the installers to give users the option between MSFS2020 and MSFS2024 and users should be able to use the existing products without any paid upgrades. However, it's worth noting that if an add-on takes advantage of the new features exclusive to FS2024, such as the ability to perform specialized tasks, SimWorks Studios may choose to charge extra for such expansions. For example, if an aircraft like the Kodiak 100 requires additional work to enable the dropping of parachutists, an expansion product might be introduced with an associated cost. Nevertheless, if the existing add-ons continue to function flawlessly in FS2024 without any modifications, users can enjoy the enhancements without any additional charges. â In other news, developers have announced updates for the RV-10 and RV-14 aircraft, addressing minor code bugs and compatibility issues. The RV-10 update specifically focuses on resolving problems with the PMS50 GTN650 and GTN750, while the RV-14 update improves ground handling for the taildragger variant in the Microsoft Store version. These updates are expected to be available next week, benefiting both Microsoft Store and other vendors. â Furthermore, the much-anticipated update for Okavango Delta is set to arrive next week. This update brings a total of 14 new airstrips to the region, including Chitabe FBME, Delta FBDT, Kanana FBKK, Khwai FBKR, Mapula FBND, Ntswi FBND and camp, Pom Pom FBNO, Rann FBMQ, Sanctuary FBMB, Seronga FBSH, Shakawe FBSW, Shindi FBMJ and camp, Xaxaba FBXB and camp, and Xugana FBXG. Alongside the new airstrips, the update introduces hundreds of traveling animals, which exhibit realistic behavior, including running away if approached too closely. Additionally, minor fixes have been made to existing camps and airstrips, as well as improvements to animal LOD switching. â A sneak peek at the PC-12 interior textures has been unveiled, showcasing the level of detail and customization options available. The textures for both the cockpit and cabin are being refined and improved, allowing for a fully customizable experience.Â  â Repainters will appreciate the flexibility provided, as changing a few small textures will completely refurbish the cabin's look. The advantage of this approach is that it doesn't require large 4k textures for every livery, keeping the package size manageable. The cabin has already undergone significant changes, with a new kind of wood and carpeting, demonstrating the level of customization available to users. The developers have put great effort into ensuring that the textures and details of the PC-12's interior are of the highest quality. Turning our attention to the exterior of the aircraft, the model has undergone a final cleanup to add missing details and correct placements of various items. Flap actuators have been remodeled and animated, further enhancing the realism of the aircraft. The exterior is currently undergoing a final pass to ensure all aspects meet the highest standards and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. â So far no release date has been announced for the highly anticipated PC-12 however when we find out we will inform you here at Threshold.Â  â â â â â</summary>
