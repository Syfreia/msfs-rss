    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Alkee Creations has recently released their rendition of Larestan International Airport (OISL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Lar, in Iran.Â   With its initial operations dating back to 1983, it was an exclusively domestic airport until the end of the Persian Gulf War, when it got its first international route to Dubai.Â   The airport is owned by the Government of Iran and operated by Iran Airports Company, featuring a single terminal that can handle up to 250,000 passengers a year. Â  The annual figures sit at 161,000 passengers annually (as of 2017). Itâs served by five airlines, including flydubai (Dubai), Iran Air (Doha, Dubai, Kuwait City, and Tehran-Mehrabad), Kish Air (Najaf, Tehran-Mehrabad), Pars Air (Tehran-Mehrabad), and Qeshm Air (Dubai, and Tehran-Mehrabad).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the passenger terminal with its interior, PBR texturing on most models, accurate ground layout, taxi signs and taxiways according to real-world charts, accurate windsock positioning, and FPS-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $7.44, requiring at least 297.47 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>The Secret Studio Releases Kuching International Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Secret Studio has recently released their rendition of Kuching International Airport (WBGG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in Malaysia with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  Kuching Intl serves the southwestern region of Sarawak, in Malaysia, sitting just 11 kilometers south of Kuching. The structure is partially shared with RMAF Kuching, which houses the 7th squadron of the Royal Malaysian Air Force.Â   The airport started as an airstrip in 1938, with 640 meters of total length. The first terminal building came nearly 12 years later, relatively small, âLâ shaped, and single-story. The runway then was just 1,372 meters long. With the rapid growth in the 50s, the early 1960s saw further expansion work, with a new runway lengthening and a terminal enlargement.Â   The 1970s started with plans to transform Kuching into an international airport, which demanded further runway length and terminal size expansions. It all came to fruition within that decade, with the runway reaching 2,454 meters in length, and the new terminal opened in 1983, replacing the old one with a three-story, 13,000 square meters passenger terminal.  The early 2000s brought a massive increase in traffic figures, making the now-old terminal feel cramped. They have decided to build a new terminal from the inside out and progressively replace the old bits. It was inaugurated in January 2006, with full completion in April of that same year. It increased the terminal size from 13,000 to 46,000 square meters, along with a runway extension from the former 2,454 meters to 3,780 meters.Â   KIA is served by nine airlines (AirAsia, AirAsia X, Batik Air Malaysia, Firefly, Malaysia Airlines, MASwings, MYAirline, Royal Brunei Airlines, and Scoot), sporting a significant domestic network and a couple of international destinations.Â   The scenery features custom-made buildings that match as closely as possible with reference data, a custom CAT I ILS for runway 07, a detailed rendition of the main passenger terminal with its interior, retail booths, and stores, and a custom-made VDGS system.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.11, requiring at least 467.30 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Updates 737 Lineup for MSFS SU12</title>
    <updated>2023-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently issued a new update to their 737 Lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator, adding SU12 compatibility, bug fixes, Â navdata format changes, and structural work to support the upcoming Universal Flight Tablet better.  Among the bug fixes, itâs important to mention that PMDG has addressed the parking brake bug introduced with SU12 Beta. Itâs a temporary fix that will give mostly regular operation but with some oddities if the user has high-end pedals, as the parking brake could be set or released without entirely depressing both pedals. They mention it will be reverted to the usual logic once Asobo fixes the problem.  In theÂ announcement post, PMDG briefly mentioned the status of the remainder of the 737 lineup in regards to their Marketplace availability, saying itâs still being prepared and the release date will vary according to Microsoftâs approval process, which has been sped up recently but they hesitate on setting a specific timeline. The same applies to the upcoming Xbox compatibility, with no timeframe but work being done in the meantime.Â   The Universal Flight Tablet is progressing nicely, with a functioning Operational Performance Tool and charts. Both features are soon to hit testing for validation. They also mention further work on improving the UI/UX before the testing begins, which is why they havenât shown any screenshots yet.  They finish with the NAVDATA progress, which is still underway and soon to hit testing, allowing for advanced FMS lateral path management capabilities once itâs done.  The complete changelog follows down below: â The 737 lineup is available on the PMDG Shop for $34.99 (737-600), $49.99 (737-900), and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Pictures are courtesy of Pineapple_Wizard.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Chudoba Design has recently released their rendition of GÃ¶teborg Landvetter Airport (ESGG) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving the city of Gothenburg in Sweden. Itâs the second largest airport in the country after Stockholm-Arlanda, averaging nearly 7 million passengers yearly.  The airport, built to replace the Torslanda Airport, was inaugurated in October 1977 by King Carl XVI Gustaf after five years of construction work. Itâs located in HÃ¤rryda, a municipality near Gothenburg, yet named after the neighboring administrative district (Landvetter) because it was easier to pronounce. Air traffic was launched three days later, with a SAS DC-9 being the first airplane to land on the runway. The first day of operations saw around 60 movements in total.Â   Landvetter originally had two terminals, built to handle up to 3,500,000 passengers yearly. Eventually, they merged into a single terminal with eleven air bridges and many remote stands.Â   Itâs a focus city for Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, SunClass Airlines, and TUI fly Nordic, sporting a considerable inter-European route network. The visitorsâ list includes major European carriers, like Air France, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Finnair, KLM, Lufthansa, and Swiss.Â   The scenery features PBR textures, SAM integration, performance-oriented optimization, custom buildings and objects, custom jetways, accurate night lighting, and compatibility with X-Plane 11 and 12.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.25, requiring at least 1.8 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. DeltaWing Simulations, the developers of the CRJ 700/900 for X-Plane, have released the next model of the CRJ family. The CRJ-1000 is the largest member of the Canadair Regional Jet Family and the final model produced.Â  The Mitsubishi CRJ-1000 was originally designed and built by Bombardier Aerospace of Canada. The CRJ-1000 was the final model of the CRJ family. The -1000 was an extension of the earlier models and featured more powerful General Electric engines. This aircraft has a seating capacity for 107 passengers in a single-class layout, which proved to make the aircraft extremely unpopular in the North American regional market. The CRJ-700 was the overwhelmingly more successful model of the family. This was due to the United States Regional Carriers being limited by scope clauses set by the larger mainline aircraft. The CRJ-1000 ended production in 2018 having only produced 63 units.Â  The DeltaWing CRJ-1000 has many features users of their CRJ 700/900 products will already be familiar with, a brief feature list is as follows: â To find the complete feature list, or to purchase the aircraft, please visit the X-Plane.org Store. This aircraft will cost $49.95 USD and is X-Plane 12 compatible only. Existing owners of the CRJ-700 or -900 can find a coupon for 30% off with the invoice for your original purchase.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Chios Island National Airport (LGHI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 16th busiest airport in Greece with a yearly average of 240,000 passengers. It serves Chios, the fifth-largest Greek island.  Owned by the government, Chios Airport started its operations in mid-1969 with an Olympic Airways flight from Athens. It underwent several upgrades, including a new passenger terminal in the 1980s. According to Greek Travel Pages, the airport recently received 9.6 million euros in funding from the National Strategic Reference Framework to upgrade the infrastructure and facilities, expanding the terminal to comport higher traffic figures. Deputy Minister Giorgios Karagiannis has mentioned itâs part of a broader plan to modernize the airports in the country.  With a single, 1,511-meter-long runway, it mostly gets regional traffic from either Olympic Air or Sky Expressâ ATR fleet, but it can fit up to an Airbus A320/ Boeing 738. The airlines mentioned above are the only ones currently serving the airport, with frequent flights to Athens, Thessaloniki, Lemnos, Mytilene, Rhodes, and Samos.Â   The scenery features hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation with custom ground decals, signposts, vegetation, parking barriers, and more, accurate real-world decals and advertisements, accurately placed lighting, surrounding objects including shops and boats, and hand-placed ground service equipment properly scattered around.Â   Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $8.58, requiring at least 1.84 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Yesterday, Chudoba Design made an announcement post on theirÂ Facebook pageÂ regarding their release of Gothenburg for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12 and a new project, temporarily named "Project People," bringing Inverse Kinematics animated 3D people into X-Plane.  The project will involve renting a motion capture studio for two weeks in April to capture a wide range of movements that can be used to create models of idle people, passengers, ramp agents, and more. These models will be imported into X-Plane as an extensive library, and the best part is that it will be free for users and freeware scenery creators. Payware scenery creators will only need to pay a small fee per airport that uses the library.Â   They have also mentioned the possibility of a potential MSFS conversion in the future "if everything goes well" while also reinforcing it's their biggest project to date.Â  â While the focus is currently on "Project People," Chudoba Design plans to bring more sceneries to X-Plane and convert some of their existing sceneries to MSFS. LBBG, HETB, and HEMM will be brought to MSFS, and they also plan to recreate some objects in LROP and completely recreate groundpoly in LKPR. With all these exciting developments, users can look forward to an even more immersive simulation experience with Chudoba Design.  There is no information on a potential release date, but the developer recommends keeping an eye on theirÂ DiscordÂ for further details.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SkyDesigners has recently released their rendition of the Cambrai-Ãpinoy Air Base (LFQI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a deactivated air base near Cambrai in France.  Created by the Germans during WW1, it was taken by the French air force right after the war, becoming âAir Base 103â (around 1936). It was once again occupied by the Germans during WW2, between 1940 and 1944, stationing several Luftwaffe units. The British took over briefly during the liberation of France, and it was handed back to the French in 1945.  It was renamed in 1959 after Commander RenÃ© Mouchotte, who died fighting for France in 1944.  The air base was officially closed in 2013, after many years of history and two world wars, bolstering over 1,500 personnel during its glory days.Â   In April 2017, the site was purchased. It will undergo a conversion process to become the largest e-Commerce warehouse in Europe, with 700,000 square meters of built area, costing around 300 million euros to make, and potentially generating 1,300 jobs, heavily benefitting the region: the unemployment rate at Cambrai sits at 24% (as of 2017).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the air base as it was before its conversion into a warehouse, with multiple static aircraft (Mirage 2000C, 2000Bs, with their real numbers and registrations), maintenance zones and hangars as of 2010, specific service vehicles and ground crew, photorealistic buildings, accurate modeling of military installations and their squadrons, hundreds of custom objects, MIAC charts for the corresponding period, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.12, requiring at least 766.13 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Orbx Releases Rockhampton Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Rockhampton Airport (YBRK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a major Australian regional airport serving the city of Rockhampton. Itâs the 17th busiest airport in the country, with a yearly average of 634,913 passengers (as of 2014-2015).  The airport opened in March 1930 as Rockhampton Aero Club flying field after many years of collective effort to find a suitable site in the city to build an aerodrome. It was built on top of a former racecourse, Connor Park, acquired by some aspiring aviators and adapted for airplanes. The first passenger aircraft to touch Rockhamptonâs runway was a Fokker monoplane during the opening ceremony.Â   Between 1938 and 2021, Rockhampton Airport hosted a meteorological office providing proper weather observation for airplanes and general purposes. It was closed two years ago after generating a lot of discussion between the locals.  The airport saw its first upgrades during World War 2, with its total land size doubling, and a new 1,250-yard bitumen runway was built to reduce the dust being stirred up by the propellers and causing discomfort to passengers and interfering with the meteorological station. The Australian Royal Air Force moved in shortly after, establishing an Aeradio station that survived until 1992.Â   Due to its proximity to the Fitzroy River, the airport is prone to closures when the river floods, which caused it to close many times over in 1954, 1991, 2011, and 2017, which eventually prompted a proposal to relocate the airport.Â   Rockhampton was redeveloped in 2008 at the cost of 8 million Australian dollars, which included a complete renovation of the terminal, removing an old viewing deck, a new cafÃ©/restaurant, relocation of offices and check-in counters, and a customs screening point for international flights, along with new air conditioning equipment and improved lighting.Â   Recently, the airport saw a new upgrade, with a 41 million dollar refurbishment that included new body scanners and body screening equipment, private airline lounges, a FIFO hub, additional retail and hospitality businesses, and a slight update on existing amenities. Work progressed further than expected because it coincided with the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.  Itâs currently served by four airlines: Bonza (Sunshine Coast, Townsville), QantasLink (Brisbane, Cairns, Mackay, Townsville), Skytrans Airlines (Cairns and Proserpine), and Virgin Australia (Brisbane).  The scenery features a detailed rendition of Rockhampton Airport with ultra-high-resolution textures, custom groundpoly, taxiway lighting, military and GA static aircraft, interior terminal modeling of the departure area, terraformed runways, drainage channels, taxiways, and aprons, and crisp 15cm aerial imagery.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.39, requiring at least 1.17 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Microsoft has released sim update 12. This update includes multiple bug fixes as well as some new features. Big features include WASM support for Xbox usersÂ and new controls for turbulence. The biggest release as a part of this update is WASM support. WASM is the core script to Microsoft Flight Simulator and is attributed to the lack of support for addons in the Xbox edition. With this script being added to the Xbox edition, we will begin to see add-ons that were only available for PC move into the Xbox edition.Â  Along with the WASM support, numerous general fixes were made, and several improvements were also made to the navigation/ traffic system. Live weather also received a big update with new controls for turbulence. The Garmin G3000 and G5000 systems received updates to improve functionality and accuracy.Â  Â Finally, several aircraft received fixes and improvements, with the A310, Cessna Citation Longitude, and the Cessna Citation CJ4 receiving the most updates.Â  â For a full list of improvements and more information on how to install this update, please visit the Microsoft Flight Simulator Forum for more details.Â  â</summary>
