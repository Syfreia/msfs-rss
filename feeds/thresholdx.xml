    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of John F. Kennedy International Airport (KJFK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in New York City with a yearly average of 60 million passengers. Built on top of an old golf course 74 years ago, the then-called Idlewild Airport had a single 7,365 square meter terminal and six runways. The current name only came to be in late 1963, after John F. Kennedyâs assassination. It also marked the important leap to the busiest airport in the region, beating LaGuardia and reaching a respectable second place overall in the United States. The busiest international gateway to the United States is served and visited by over 90 airlines, covering all the inhabited continents around the globe. JetBlue tops the market share chart, with 28.8% or 15,624,961 passengers, followed by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, with 28.4% (15,390,437) and 14.5% (7,870,971), respectively. From foreign operators, Air France leads the way with 1.9% of the total market share or 1,025,339 passengers. The scenery features hand-made ground textures, a true-to-life airport landside recreation, accurately modeled and positioned lighting, high-detail models of all airport buildings and objects (and surroundings), accurate taxi signage, an updated layout, custom-built jetways with variations as per real life, a fully animated JFK AirTrain between each terminal, a precise representation of the famous Canarsie Approach, LOD optimization for every model, custom static aircraft (optional), and full compatibility with the iniManager scenery configurator. It also includes a replica of the TWA Hotel with an intricately detailed interior and the Constellation aircraft in TWA colors.  Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $25.04, requiring at least 4.25 GB of free hard disk space to install. The developers recommend uninstalling Asoboâs hand-crafted KJFK to avoid performance issues.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Long Island MacArthur Airport (KISP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the population of Long Island in southeastern New York State with a yearly average of 1.6 million passengers.  Built in 1942 with financial help from the Civil Aeronautics Administration (now FAA), which funded the construction of three paved runways, it was soon renamed MacArthur Airport after General Douglas MacArthur, famous for his dramatic escape from the Philippines. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation built the first hangar only two years later, and the first terminal came in 1949.Â   Commercial service began in 1960 with Allegheny Airlines, offering flights to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. A bigger passenger terminal was completed six years later, further expanding the airportâs passenger handling capabilities. By the end of the 1960s, Allegheny and Mohawk Airlines offered several flights a day. The 1970s brought American Airlines and Delta Air Lines onboard.  Expansion work started in 2004, with the construction of a brand new Southwest Terminal for $65 million, adding four new gates and space for restaurants and shops. Two years later, they built another four new gates. The expansion was made without state approval and violated fire and safety codes, causing a fair share of drama.Â   MacArthur Airport is currently served by three airlines: Breeze Airways (Charleston), Frontier Airlines (Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, and West Palm Beach), and Southwest Airlines (Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa, and West Palm Beach).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail models of the airport terminals, hangars, buildings, and other facilities, with terminal interiors, custom animated jetways, up-to-date taxiways and stands, custom lighting, and animated humans.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $21.00, requiring at least 1.57 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Darwin International Airport (YPDN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the tenth busiest airport in Australia with a yearly average of 2.0 million passengers.  Darwin Airport started as Parap Airfield in 1919, operating as a civilian and military field. It played an important role during WW2, used by the Allies to project air power into the Pacific. Soon after the war, the military airfield part was made available to civilian traffic, and the former civilian part was closed down.  A new passenger terminal was made in 1991, increasing the passenger handling capabilities of the then-primary domestic and international airport of the Northern Territory. It wasnât until 2015 that it got massively expanded. An 85 million Australian dollar expansion project brought the terminal from 16,000 to 27,000 square meters, with new airline lounges, more check-in stands, and six boarding gates.Â   The airport is served by Airnorth (Alice Springs, Broome, Cairns, Dili, Elcho Island, Gove, Groote Eylandt, Katherine, Kununurra, Maningrida, McArthur River Mine, Milingimbi, Tennant Creek, The Granites, Townsville), Alliance Airlines (Dili), Fly Tiwi (Gapuwiyak, Milikapiti, Minjilang, Nguiu, Pirlangimpi, Ramingining, Tennant Creek, Warruwi), Jetstar (Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Denpasar, Melbourne, Singapore, Sydney), Qantas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), QantasLink (Adelaide, Alice Springs, Broome, Cairns, Canberra, Dili, Townsville), Singapore Airlines (Singapore), Virgin Australia (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), and Virgin Australia Regional Airlines (Perth).

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TaiModels has recently released their rendition of Hong Kong International (VHHH) for X-Plane 11 and 12, the 8th busiest airport in the World with a yearly average of 71 million passengers.  Hong Kong International was built to replace the old Â Kai Tak Airport, deemed too small to handle the amount of traffic it was dealing with and the insane amount of complaints from airlines because of all the delays that were a direct consequence of the fact it just could not scale up to the demand. Planning studies started in 1974, with construction work only kicking in almost 20 years later, in 1991. Completion was achieved in early 1998.  Built on a large artificial island, the total area of the airport (12.48 square kilometers) corresponds to nearly 1% of Hong Kongâs total area.Â   The airport is a hub for Cathay Pacific, Greater Bay Express, HK Express, and Hong Kong Airlines and is visited by over 100 other airlines with more than 180 destinations. Itâs also the Worldâs busiest cargo airport, hosting Air Hong Kong, Cathay Cargo, DHL Aviation, Hong Kong Airlines Cargo, Kalitta Air, Polar Air Cargo, and UPS Airlines.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of Hong Kong International Airport, with high-quality textures, complete autogen around the city, ground traffic plugins, weather textures for X-Plane 12, high-detail models inside the terminal, PBR materials, performance-friendly optimization, and compatibility with X-Plane 11 and 12.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $28.54, requiring at least 4.03 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Rfscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Federico Fellini International Airport (LIPR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Rimini in San Marino.Â   Its history dates back to the early 1930s when the first airfield was built in Rimini. Initially, the airfield was used primarily for military purposes during World War II. After the war, it was converted into a civilian airport.  Over the next few decades, Rimini-Miramare Airport underwent several renovations and expansions, including the construction of a new passenger terminal in the 1960s. However, as air traffic to the region continued to grow, it became clear that the airport needed to be further upgraded to meet the needs of modern aviation.  In the late 1990s, plans were made to upgrade the airport and expand its facilities. The new airport was designed by the architect Marco Bacchini, and the construction work began in 2004. The project included the construction of a new passenger terminal, a new control tower, a new runway, and other facilities.  The new airport was officially opened on June 15, 2011, and was named Federico Fellini International Airport in honor of the famous film director born in Rimini.Â   Itâs served on a seasonal basis by Albawings, Iran Air, Luxair, Neos, Ryanair, and WizzAir (the only one to offer a flight all year long to Tirana). The passenger figures sit at 900,000 a year.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom airport buildings, landside buildings, custom clutter, custom night lighting, and realistic ground markings.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.57, requiring at least 251.81 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. ColombiaVFR has recently released CapurganÃ¡ Airport (SKCA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the coastal town of CapurganÃ¡ in Colombia.Â   The city isn't accessible via roads, meaning only airplanes and boats can get there, making the airport an important - and fast - link to the rest of the country.  The airport is operated by the Colombian Civil Aviation Authority and has a small terminal building that provides basic facilities such as check-in counters, waiting areas, and restrooms.  CapurganÃ¡ Airport is known for its scenic location, surrounded by lush tropical forests and crystal-clear waters. The airport is near some of Colombia's most beautiful beaches, including Playa Blanca and El Aguacate. As a result, the airport is a popular destination for tourists who wish to explore the region's natural beauty and enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, snorkeling, and fishing.  Despite its popularity, CapurganÃ¡ Airport has limited flight options, with only a few airlines operating regular flights to and from the airport. The airport is also known for its challenging approach, as the runway is on a narrow strip of land between the sea and the mountains, making landing and takeoff difficult in certain weather conditions.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-detailed custom models, custom clutter, and lots of minor details such as graffiti art (as per real life), an abandoned airplane, and more.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.46, requiring at least 1.61 GB of free hard disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

V1 Studio has recently released their rendition of Walther Moreira Salles Airport (SBPC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of PoÃ§os de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil.  Inaugurated in early 1938 (making it one of the oldest airports in Brazil), with the presence of the then president, GetÃºlio Dornelles Vargas, it was built with ambitious plans of linking the city to Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo, and Belo Horizonte. VASP and Panair, present at the inauguration ceremony, were the first airlines ever to serve PoÃ§os de Caldas Airport, followed by Aerovias Brasil in 1945.Â   Since 1991, the airport no longer has scheduled flights, used exclusively for private aircraft, air taxis, and pilot training.Â  Â  Itâs the second highest airport in Brazil between medium and large-sized airports, at an impressive 1,260 meters above sea level.Â   Three years ago, the airport underwent revitalization work, with all the taxi lines and markings on the runway being repainted, lighting improvements, and the installation of optical fiber cables for a future meteorological station.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom lighting, high-detail airport buildings, custom-made vegetation, and a Â realistic ground layout. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ and GearDown Simulations Store for roughly $8.20, requiring at least 1.03 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. France VFR has recently released their rendition of TarbesâLourdesâPyrÃ©nÃ©es Airport (LFBT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the community of Tarbes in France with a yearly average of 450,000 passengers.  The airport was built in the 1940s as a military airfield, dabbling into commercial service after WW2, with commercial flights beginning operating from the airport in the early 1950s. The airport was gradually expanded over the years, and in 1968, a new terminal building was constructed.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the airport underwent significant renovations and upgrades. In 1988, a new runway was built, which enabled larger aircraft to operate from the airport. In 1993, a new passenger terminal was opened, designed to handle up to 800,000 passengers annually.  The airport has been used for commercial and military purposes throughout history. During the Gulf War in the early 1990s, the airport was used as a base for French military operations. In recent years, the airport has become a vital hub for pilgrimage tourism, with many flights carrying Catholic pilgrims to the nearby city of Lourdes.  The airport is served seasonally by AeroItalia (Forli) and AlbaStar (Bergamo). EasyJet (Milan-Malpensa), Ryanair (Bergamo, Charleroi, Dublin, LondonâStansted, Malta, RomeâCiampino), and Volotea (Paris-Orly), on the other hand, offer flights all year long.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution aerial ground imagery, detailed ground markings, photo-realistic 3D buildings, realistic night lighting, custom runway slope, multiple charts provided, and compatibility with the VFR France product range.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for $9.02, requiring at least 298.02 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport (KJAN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Jackson metropolitan area with a yearly average of 1 million passengers.  The airport opened in 1963, replacing Hawkins Field, Jacksonâs former main airport since 1928. Construction took around three years and came at a total cost of 6 million USD (equivalent to 56,000,000 USD in 2023).Â   Itâs named after Medgar Evers (since 2005), a Mississippi Field Secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who was assassinated in June 1963.Â  Â   The airport is served by American Eagle (Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington-National), Delta Air Lines (Atlanta), Southwest Airlines (Atlanta, Baltimore, Houston-Hobby, Orlando), and United Express (Houston-Intercontinental). In addition to passenger flights, the airport handles cargo shipments, with UPS flying to Louisville.  The scenery features a highly accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail models of the terminals (and their respective interiors), hangars, buildings, and other facilities. Taxiways, aprons, and stands have their layouts on par with real life, with custom jetways and realistic dynamic lighting.Â   Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $18.47, requiring at least 4.36 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Aerosoft Teases Progress on the A330 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently shared further information on the development of their Airbus A330 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, including a batch of new images, the entrance into a closed beta stage, and more!  Mathijs Kok, Aerosoft's Product Manager, fed theirÂ A330 Preview ThreadÂ with a fresh batch of external imagery of their upcoming widebody, along with the information their beta testers can now send exterior shots of the aircraft. He then described the product's current stage regarding models, textures, animations, flight modeling, FADEC, manuals, autopilot, systems, etc. Description of which follows down below, verbatim: â Modeling, texturing, and almost all animations are solid. No worries about that.Â  In fact, Stefan and Anne are already working on the next bus.Â  Flight modeling, Engine modeling, and FADEC were massive issues, but we are 99% sure we can get within 3% of correct behavior. Any pilot will tell you that is fine as one airframe differs from another. Having two engines on one aircraft that differ by 3% is fine. Don't be mistaken, 3% is pretty much state-of-the-art.Â  Manuals and E-manual are more or less okay. The PDF manuals will be fine and available on release, the E-manual which is one of the highlights of the project as we want to get even beginners to be able to fly the A330 will be available but will need to be updated with the latest changes in code. Autopilot still needs work but is basically not very complex. It flies the route, does a cool ILS intercept, and lands fine. Systems are more or less okay. This is one area where you can spend another 20 years because where the real aircraft just has to display what is happening, we need to model why it happens. So when a computer decides the cabin needs to be heated a bit, a system will divert heat from an engine to a heat exchanger and feed the warmed air to the cabin. That means the engine will be affected, the electrical system will be involved and that means the generators will need to provide a bit more power. And that drops the thrust of the engine. See the complexity? We have a whopping lot of that code running because of some professional spin-offs of the bus projects. It's there and somewhere in Germany, a developer is crying because no customer will ever see it.Â  EFB, we are very proud of the EFB.Â  and while we need some tweaks, all is well. Navigraph, NavDataPro, weather, runway data, simbrief integration, are all working. I just love to be able to update the weather data automatically before planning an arrival, The fact we incorporated our own sat imagery so you can be sure you are doing your taxi route okay.. cool. MCDU, LNAV, VNAV... That is where we have most work open. Logically as it is by far the most complex part of the aircraft. LNAV seems to work, VNAV not so much but we know what we need to do.Â  ECAMS, loads of tweaks in fonts, placement, and things like that open (we had some bad luck in that part) but it is not code that affects flight.Â  Still one of my main worries now. Marketplace. This is the work you need to do to get something on the Marketplace. Not only contracts but a whopping lot of things you have to add. Not complex but I still need a few days on that for sure. Installer/Protection. With our own Aerosoft One system that is tried and tested (our DRM has not been hacked and has next to makes life for the customer easier (no need to enter any serial!s)) we are not worried about that at all.Â  Support, they are fully included in the testing so they should know what they need. Marketing. This department will be getting all information from me very soon.Â  They will invite streamers to have a look at the product before release and get the word out to websites and magazines. Sales still have to make sure that all our associate sale channels get all the marketing data and on release the files.  BaxterChico, one of their testers, has also shared some screenshots:  There's still no information regarding pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed as things progress! â</summary>
