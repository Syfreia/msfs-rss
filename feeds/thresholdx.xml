    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda Design has recently added a new airplane to their Dynamic Generation Series lineup: the Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander, a British light utility aircraft released in 1969. â  The BN-2A is an evolution of the Britten-Norman BN2, which took off for the first time in 1965. With aerodynamic and flight equipment improvements, along with a slightly more powerful engine, the BN-2A turned good into better. The engines and its robust construction allow the aircraft to operate from unprepared airstrips, making it a popular choice for remote and inaccessible locations where traditional runways may be limited or absent. It soon became the airplane of choice for humanitarian missions, surveillance, aerial survey, and commercial island hops.  Seating up to nine passengers and featuring an easy way to reconfigure for cargo transportation, medical evacuation, or any task at hand, the BN-2A is versatile.  Powered by two piston engines, the Lycoming 0-540 or the Textron Lycoming TIO-540, it cruises at 140 knots, with a total range of 800 nautical miles. The combination of fuel efficiency and low operating costs has made it popular worldwide. As of late 2019, 800 islanders were still flying out of the 1,280 built.  The add-on features a fully configurable 3D instrument panel, full VR compatibility, over 50 instruments to choose from, 3D lighting, a dynamic livery editor, 8K high-resolution PBR textures, individual functional circuit breakers, detailed and accurate flight dynamics, an advanced FMOD-based sound system, and more. The complete feature list follows down below:  Special features: Feature-rich elegant fly-out menu with the following features: Flight dynamics and systems: Advanced FMOD-based sound system:  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for roughly $34.95, requiring at least 2.8 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Nimbus Studio has recently updated their Britten-Norman BN-2B Islander, adding compatibility with X-Plane 12.    The Britten-Norman BN-2 was developed in 1963, with its creators aiming to create a reliable, cheap, and fuel-efficient aircraft. They wanted a plane that would sacrifice cruise speed or range for a higher payload, lifting more weight than the competition ever could. With 1,280 built and over 700 in use, itâs easy to say they have succeeded.  The BN-2B Islander is an improved version of the BN-2 with better soundproofing, increased takeoff, and landing weight, and minor improvements, making it more suitable for passenger transport.Â   The BN-2 family is known for its versatility, with an easily configurable interior that can carry passengers (up to nine), cargo, or even work as a medevac airplane. On top of all that, itâs also STOL capable, allowing it to operate anywhere in the world. Itâs a British jack-of-all-trades.  The add-on features X-Plane 12 compatibility, a highly detailed 3D model, 4K textures, PBR texturing, a custom sound system, accurate handling and flight characteristics, real performance based on performance charts, and VR compatibility.  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for roughly $34.95, requiring at least 1.2 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to Highbrow for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SIMMAN has recently released their rendition of Khon Kaen International Airport (VTUK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Mueang Khon Kaen in Thailand with a yearly average of 1,568,000 passengers.  Built by the Japanese Army during World War 2, the then airfield featured a 1,300-meter-long runway with no navigational aids, which was eventually expanded when the war ended, and the airport was converted into a civilian facility.Â   In 1962, the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand revamped the airport's infrastructure for the first time, building parking lots, hangars, garages, and basic buildings to handle passenger traffic. A year later, Thai Airways started flying to Khon Kaen with a DC-3 from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani, carrying passengers, cargo, and mail.Â   A new passenger terminal was approved in 2017, expanding the airport's size to 45,500 square meters. The construction work started a year later. The finished project should raise the passenger handling capabilities to 5.5 million passengers a year and support wide-body aircraft like the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 777.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a 3D terminal and its interior, an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, custom jetways, and custom night lighting.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $18.07, requiring at least 344.83 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TaiModels has recently released their rendition of Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (KPHF) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving the Virginia Peninsula in the United States with a yearly average of 430,000 passengers.  The airport was originally part of a military base from World War 2, Camp Patrick Henry. They got 924 areas of that land, where they built a 1,100-meter-long runway. Scheduled service started shortly after in November 1949 with Piedmont Airlines and Capital Airlines.Â   In 1951, the terminal was heavily damaged by a fire, prompting them to rebuild it and upgrade the airport while at it with an upgraded traffic control tower and a longer runway (400 meters longer). The new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1955.  Williamsburg Airport, then Patrick Henry Airport, was granted international status in 1975, with four airlines serving the airport nonstop: Allegheny, National, Piedmont, and United. The airport could finally handle international traffic (airline and corporate) with a brand-new customs facility.  With the airline deregulation in 1978, the airport lost most of its jet service: National in 1978, Piedmont and Allegheny in 1979, and United in 1981.Â   In 1984, with the airport falling deeper and deeper into a massive crisis, they hired a new executive director, who brought a new plan to the table: implementing a business park within the airport to attract air carriers. A year later, it was Americaâs fastest-growing airport, the success of which was also repeated in 1986. The jets were back.  In September 1990, the airport got its current name: Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport.Â   In the early 2000s, they launched another expansion effort, adding new parking lots, opening new passenger concourses, and bringing more airlines.Â   For the past decade, the airport has entered a fast decline. It all started with AirTran Airways stopping their operations after its merger with Southwest Airlines, hitting the passenger count significantly. Then, in 2020, Delta suspended their service to Atlanta. In July 2022, there was a glimmer of hope with Avelo Airlines, but they suspended their operations a year later.  The airport is only served by American Eagle (Charlotte) and Netjets (Birmingham, Columbus, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Raleigh-Durham, and Teterboro).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail models, SAM jetways, high-quality PBR textures, performance-friendly optimization, custom autogen around the airport, ground traffic plugins, and weather textures (X-Plane 12 only).  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.91, requiring at least 1.22 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FSDesigns Releases Jacksonville International Airport for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FSDesigns has recently released their rendition of Jacksonville International Airport (KJAX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 6,500,000 passengers.  Jacksonville International was conceived as a replacement for Imeson Field, which has served Jacksonville since 1927. It was simply not big enough to handle the increased demand for air travel, and the runways could not be expanded due to terrain limitations.Â   Inaugurated in 1968, its growth could have been faster, with only two million passengers a year by 1982 (way below expectation). However, the 90s saw a massive increase, with the average hitting the 5 million mark. In 2000, they approved an expansion plan to rebuild the landside terminal, central square, main concessions area, and a parking area expansion.  In 2006, they rolled out the second phase of the expansion program, rebuilding concourses A and C, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills. The crisis of 2009 stopped any other ongoing expansion work, with the old Concourse B being demolished and only considered for rebuilding ten years later when the traffic figures were healthy again. The pandemic, though, halted that project, which should begin by the summer of 2023.  Itâs served by Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Silver Airways, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express. American, Delta, and Southwest hold most of the market share, with 20% each.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality 3D models, custom ground textures, an optimized terminal interior, an up-to-date airport layout, SAM jetways, 3D vegetation, dynamic night lighting, and custom wear and tear using the latest technology.  Itâs available onÂ the X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $19.99, requiring at least 1.26 GB of free hard disk space. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of St. Louis Lambert International Airport (KSTL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving metropolitan St. Louis with a yearly average of 13 million passengers.  Opened 100 years ago, St. Louis started its life as an airfield with the addition of hangars and a passenger terminal two years later, in 1925. In that same decade, it became one of the first airports to have an air traffic control system, although via flags instead of radio communication.  In 1928, it became one of the first municipally owned airports in the United States after the city paid 2 million dollars to Albert Bond Lambert, its owners, and one of the most famous precursors of aviation in St. Louis, being the first licensed pilot in the city and part of the leadership of the Missouri Aeronautical Society.  During World War 2, it became a manufacturing facility for McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Curtiss-Wright.  In the 1950s, the airport got a new passenger terminal to handle the increased air travel demand, costing 7.2 million dollars and bringing an innovative dome design that preceded JFK (New York) and CDG (Paris). By 1957, they had 44 weekday TWA departures, 24 from American Airlines, 16 from Delta, 14 from Ozark Airlines, 13 from Eastern Air Lines, six from Braniff, and two from Central.Â   In the 1970s, Missouri residents rejected a proposal to build a new airport in suburban Illinois. Later in that decade, the airport underwent a massive expansion project that expanded the runways, increased the number of gates to 81, and boosted its overall capacity.Â   Following the airline deregulation in 1978, the dominant forces at St. Louis were TWA with 36 routes and Ozark with 25, followed by American and Eastern with 17 and 12, respectively.Â   As a direct consequence of the deregulation, airlines adopted a hub model. St. Louis became one of TWA's hubs, flying people all over America and even across the ocean to London, Paris, and Frankfurt.Â   With the aviation crisis that followed 9/11, TWA ceased operations and got bought out by American, which couldn't afford to keep St. Louis as one of their hubs. Southwest preyed on that by boosting their daily departures and overall participation. Currently, they hold 61.40% of the passenger market share, followed by American Airlines (12%) and Delta Air Lines (7.70%).Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with over 60 custom buildings, custom animated jetways, custom night lighting, custom ground clutter, realistic terrain elevation, and high-resolution ground textures.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.07, requiring at least 685.08 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently uploaded a 14-minute video showcasing the sounds of their upcoming Fokker F28 Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a short-range jet airliner from the late 1960s. The video covers various sound examples, ranging from knobs to the engineâs scream on the take-off rollâminutes upon minutes of each and every sound an F28 produces. First flown in May 1967, the Fokker F28 was developed to compete with turboprop airliners, carrying the same amount of passengers but cruising faster and offering more straightforward operation based on American design methodologies.  Its development was aided by feedback from many of their F27 operators, mainly North Americans, hence the âAmericanisationâ of the F28 to make it sell even better on American soil. With 241 units built in total, Fokker made six variants of the F28 with different carrying capacities and lengths.  Thereâs still no information on pricing or a potential release date, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Ontario International Airport (KONT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of San Bernardino, Riverside, and Greater Los Angeles with a yearly average of 5 million passengers.  The airport was built in 1941 as an Army Air Corps aircraft training and operation base. After the war, it became a large storage, sale, and scrapping center for Army Air Forces aircraft.Â   Shortly after, in 1946, the airport was renamed from âOntario Municipal Airportâ to âOntario International Airportâ because of outgoing trans-pacific cargo flights. The first international passenger flight happened that same year, a Pacific Overseas Airlines flight from Shanghai to Ontario, inaugurating round-trip air passenger service between the United States and the Orient. Western Airlines began operating at the airport three years later, followed by Bonanza Air Lines in 1955.  A new terminal was opened in 1998, discontinuing the old terminals, which now function as the administration and the USO. There are 26 gates total, with 12 on T2 and 14 on T4. Terminal 2 hosts Alaska Airlines, Avianca El Salvador, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines, and Volaris. Terminal 4 hosts American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest.  Itâs a FedEx and UPS Airlines cargo hub, transporting cargo all over North America and Asia (UPS). Amazon Air, Ameriflight, Amerijet International, Asia Pacific Airlines, and Kalitta Air also serve it. Ontario International is the ninth-largest cargo airport in the United States.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom taxi signs, parallax, LOD optimization, realistic night lighting, custom jetways with gate numbers, and more.  Itâs available onÂ Verticalsimâs Shop for $19.99, requiring at least 2.16 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to Soarandskor for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RFscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Marche Airport (LIPY) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Ancona and its surroundings with a yearly average of 489,000 passengers.  The airport started as a military airfield in the early 20th century, initially belonging to the Italian Air Force and taken over by the USAF for a few months in 1945 before being turned over to the local authorities.  It was opened for commercial operations in 1961, becoming the gateway to the Marche region in Italy. With a single terminal building and a short runway, it was only a short time until it underwent expansion work.Â   In recent years, the airport has continued to evolve and adapt to the changing aviation landscape. Various airlines, including low-cost and full-service carriers, have established routes to and from Ancona Falconara Airport, connecting the region with major cities across Europe.  Itâs served by Albawings (Tirana), easyJet (Gatwick), Lufthansa (Munich), Ryanair (Catania, Charleroi, LondonâStansted), Volotea (Cagliari, Catania, Palermo, ParisâOrly), and WizzAir (Tirana).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom 3D buildings, custom ground textures, custom GSE, realistic glass windows, and an up-to-date layout.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.17, requiring at least 526.04 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, developer SimWorks has published a Facebook post detailing the groupâs progress on their much anticipated PC-12 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, providing updates on the aircraftâs avionics, interior modeling, and lighting. According to SimWorks, the team has completed the PC-12âs electrical systems, a major milestone in the plane development. They are currently working on integrating the system with the various cockpit instruments. In addition, progress is being made on the planeâs avionics where the EADI has been finished while the finishing touches are being put on the EHSI.  As for the modeling and lighting, the developer claims that the interior design of the plane is 90%, with night lighting being gradually implemented into the cabin and cockpit. Finally, the exterior lighting of the PC-12 is now fully functional, though âa couple of quirksâ still needs to be fixed, Currently, the developers have not provided a firm release date for the airplane, nor have they disclosed the PC-12âs expected price. Threshold will keep you updated on this front â</summary>

    <title>MXI Design Releases Deauville-Normandie Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MXI Design has recently released their rendition of Deauville-Normandie Airport (LFRG) Â for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the commune of Deauville in France with a yearly average of 160,000 passengers.  Inaugurated in 1931 by the initiative of EugÃ¨ne Collas (the mayor of Deauville back then), it initially served as a business airport, eventually opening up for tourist charter flights as time went by.  For a short while, it used to be considered a third airport for Paris, but the distance (two-hour drive) and the lack of transportation options made it unfeasible, and they quickly ruled it out.  In 1952, they built a cement runway, allowing it to handle more aircraft types. Seven years later, a control tower was built, along with a runway extension to 1,600 meters in 1961.  In 1971, a passenger terminal was inaugurated, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and making it more suitable for commercial flights.Â   Recently, the operator has decided to build a new terminal, scheduled to reach completion in late 2023, expanding its area from 1,750 to 3,800 square meters. The state will cover 95% of the total cost; the remainder will come from Deauville. They also intend to add a photovoltaic park nearby to reach completion between 2024-2027. â It's served on a seasonal basis by Aegean Airlines and Volotea. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detailed PBR models of the terminals and their respective interiors (built with performance in mind), custom taxiway signs, 3D passengers, custom ground textures, and custom night lighting.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.77, requiring at least 543.61 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
