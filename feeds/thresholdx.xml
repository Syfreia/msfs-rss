    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flight Sim Development Group has just released their rendition of Bremen Airport (EDDW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city and state of Bremen in Northern Germany with a yearly average of 2.5 million passengers. The route network is mostly intra-european, served by airlines such as Corendon, Eurowings, KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SundAir, Turkish, and WizzAir.Â   The airport was built in the early 1900s, when a local aerospace club ran a couple experimental flights at the site that would then become Bremen Airport. It was then transformed into a military airport during WW1, with a reopening in 1920, when KLM had a scheduled flight to Amsterdam. In the 1930s, it was repurposed as military airfield, serving as a training base for the Luftwaffe, housing a squadron of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 bombers between late-1939 and mid-1940. It was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed, repaired in 1945, when the US Army took over and repurposed it as an airbase, only to be handed back in 1949.  The scenery features an accurate representation of Bremen Airport, with fully customized vehicles and facilities, realistic light environment and interior modeling, seasonal changes, reflective textures, compatible with GSX and Landmarks of Germany, including a custom GSX profile and a user manual.  Itâs available onÂ FSDGâs StoreÂ for roughly $23.35.Â  Shout out to Tang0 for the scoop! Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
