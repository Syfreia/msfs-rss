    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, scenery developer Dominic DesignTeam released their rendition of AustinâBergstrom International Airport (KAUS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The product will bring the Texas airport to life with high quality models, customized objects such as signs and passengers, and detailed textures. 	According to the developers, the scenery will feature PBR textures, dynamic lighting, and custom jetways. Additionally, for added realism, all pavements have been âpainstakingly hand-craftedâ and ground markings have been modeled based on the real life airport. 	AustinâBergstrom International Airport, located 5 miles from Austin downtown, is one of the main international airports serving the city. It provides flights to some 75 destinations around the world. Top operators at the airport include Southwest, Delta, and American Airlines. Currently, Dominic DesignTeamâs Austin Airport can be purchased on simMarket for $18.99 USD or EUR 20.10, excluding any sales taxes that may incur. The developers recommend at least 870M of free space in order to successfully install the product.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released an update to their rendition of Rovaniemi Airport (EFRO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the third busiest airport in Finland with 500,000 passengers per year. Itâs visited by many airlines during the winter season, which includes Aer Lingus, Air France, easyJet, Eurowings, Ryanair, Transavia, and Turkish Airlines.Â   Built in 1940, featuring two grass runways, and used as a Luftwaffe air base and supply center during the Second Soviet-Finnish War between 1941 and 1944. Rebuilding work started in 1948, with regular traffic returning in the beginning of the second half of that year.Â   The current terminal building finished in 1992, with its first expansion happening in 2000 (and the inclusion of jetways). The runway underwent renovation work in 2016, with new pavement and LED lights, and 2019 marked the completion of the terminalâs third enlargement.  The scenery update added conditional visibility to the winter objects, smoke effects for cold weather, glass improvements, and general fixes. The complete feature list for the scenery follows down below: Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for $6.69 (on sale, 50% off), requiring at least 1.23 GB of free disk space to install.

    <title>Orbx Announces Oslo Gardermoen for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-12-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recentlyÂ announcedÂ the development of Oslo Gardermoen Airport (ENGM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in Norway, nearing 30 million passengers per year with almost 200 destinations. Itâs home to Flyr, Norse Atlantic Airways, and Wideroe.Â   The airportâs history dates back to 1740 when the Norwegian army used Gardermoen (then Fredericksfeldt) as a camp. It remained as such until 1860, when barracks and stalls were constructed to house more people and protect against the harsh weather. Insulated buildings were the next logical upgrade, in the early 1900s. It became an airport in 1912 when the first of many flights took off.Â   Gardermoen was taken over by the nazis during the German occupation in 1940, building the first aircraft facilities and two runways with 2,000 meters each. The Norwegian Air Force took it back as soon as WW2 ended, housing three fighter squadrons. In 1946, Braathens SAFE used the facilities as their technical base, which only lasted for two years. It was also during that period when Oslo Gardermoen became the reserve airport for Fornebu, which used to be the main airport. All the intercontinental flights were redirected to OSL because Fornebu was undergoing runway extension work. It wasnât until 1998 that Gardermoen became the main airport in Oslo.  The scenery will feature custom orthoimagery, PBR textures in 4K, interior modeling, 3 different types of animated jetways to match the real world, fully functioning VDGS on all appropriate gates, custom ground service equipment, and optimization work to warrant good performance.  It is allegedly coming in January 2023, priced at roughly $21.00. Thereâs no information on the install size yet. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published aÂ developer updateÂ covering their progress on the UNS-1 Custom FMS for theirÂ 146 Professional, an old style FMS released in 1982 and widely used until the early 2000s, providing GPS navigation with LNAV output to the autopilot and horizontal situation indicator. Users can toggle between the modern FMS, the UNS-1, or no FMS in the Electronic Flight Bag Configuration Menu, without reloading the aircraft.Â   The new UNS-1 will be capable of loading and saving MSFS flight plans, along with full SID/STAR support with transitions and approaches. It also includes advanced features such as real-time fuel monitoring, as long as the user inputs the necessary information (passenger count, cargo, fuel quantity, etc.).Â   Like the real unit, it features VNAV, but it doesnât communicate with the autopilot, making it the user has to manually manage the climbs and descents with IAS and VS, although the built-in VNAV will be able to calculate the top of descent and target vertical speed.  The developer claims it is still under extensive testing, with guidance videos to come once itâs closer to release. Cover picture is courtesy of DragonRuins.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RDPresets has just released their rendition of Bergen Flesland Airport (ENBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in Norway with a yearly average of 6 million passengers. It is an important Scandinavian destination, served by many airlines such as Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, and WiderÃ¸e, with a significant intra-european route network.Â   The origin of the airport dates back to the early 1950s, when a national military communications project secured the construction of a 1460 meter long runway, and 4 million norwegian krone were provided by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana to build a terminal and a road. Additional NATO grants in 1953 warranted a longer runway (2440 meters) and better infrastructure. A DHC-3 Otter was the first aircraft to land on Bergen Flesland, on 18 June 1954, when only 800 meters of the runway were complete. The first revenue chartered flight was a leg to Oslo, transporting SK Brann to play a football match.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom models, PBR texturing, 3D interior, more than a thousand clutter objects on the apron, realistic and functioning VDGS, custom ground textures, performance optimization, accurate night lighting, custom taxi signage, and ground traffic.  Itâs available on theÂ RDPresets StoreÂ for roughly $21.07 or onÂ SimMarketÂ for $19.00, requiring at least 1 GB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Pyreegue Dev Co. has recently updated their rendition of Glasgow International Airport (EGPF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the ninth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom with nearly 10 million passengers yearly (pre-pandemic). It is owned and operated by AGS Airports, which also own Aberdeen and Southampton.Â   Itâs a hub for EasyJet, Loganair, Jet2.com, and TUI Airways, with many domestic and intra-European routes. British Airways features three domestic routes to London City, London Heathrow, and London Gatwick.

The busiest routes as of 2019 are London Heathrow (865,008), London Gatwick (641,566), and Dublin (500,441), operated by British Airways and Aer Lingus.  The scenery update features a new terminal glass, minor fixes to terminal geometry, static aircraft v2, major taxiway lighting improvements, minor changes to ATC Tower interior, GSX integration (with dynamic doors), added vehicle paths for ground service equipment, ground polygon adjustments, airline specific parking codes, static people replaced with animated ones, trees on the approach to runway 23 were removed, and other minor fixes and improvements.  Update 1.1.7 is now available onÂ Orbx Direct, for roughly $20.26 (update is free for current owners). Other storefronts will follow shortly, according to the developer. At least 2.65 GB of free disk space is required to install the product. The new GSX Profile is available onÂ FlightSim.to, free of charge.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently uploaded a video previewing the Regional AI Aircraft for their upcoming FS Traffic add-on. The regional set includes 12 different airplanes (A220-100, A220-200, ATR-42, ATR-72, CRJ-700, CRJ-900, CRJ-1000, Dash 8-Q400, ERJ-145, E-170, E-190, and E-195) with multiple livery combinations from around the World. The video showcases some of the new planes, the AI traffic interaction with ground service equipment, and the newly added animations and effects.Â  â  FS Traffic promises to add tens of thousands of real-life commercial flights from different periods, with worldwide coverage from a popular data source. The data covers the summer of 2022, with 2021 and 2019 to come later through a free update. The traffic will be controlled by the date and time of the day, with different densities. It also offers model-matching compatibility with platforms such as VATSIM.  On the latestÂ developer update, they claim all the core features are fully functional, with all the liveries, including additional paint jobs based on feedback from the public. Their testing team is undergoing expansion to maximize efficiency and ensure compatibility with other products.Â   There is no information on pricing and release date yet, but they claim to be aiming for an early 2023 release.
