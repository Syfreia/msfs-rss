    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research has taken to their Twitter page to showcase previews of X-Codr Designs Denver 2.0 in X-Plane 12, an upcoming free update to the popular airport. The developerâs version two rendition of Denver is set to release with a multitude of exciting changes, these include the new terminal expansions, improved ground textures, revamped terminals, and more. You can view the full feature list below. It was also confirmed by the developer that they still plan on supporting X-Plane 11. As well according to X-Codr, they donât believe that the X-Plane 12 version of the airport will require a separate download, as the X-Plane 11 version should ignore the X-Plane 12 features. Due to the strict NDA still in place for Laminarâs new simulator, the developer has stated that they wonât be making an official announcement on the forums until X-Plane 12 releases. As well, X-Codr Designs has assured users that progress on Sedona is still developing nicely, and will not be affected by Denver. It was also said that work has finished on the rocks, and the airport will be started, with previews coming soon. In the meantime, you can purchase Denver for X-Plane 11 via the X-Plane.org store for $29.95. As well, make sure to check out the source post for this article via the developerâs website, and join their discord for further information.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, scenery developer Aviotek Simulation Software has published a short update on its upcoming Frankfurt Airport scenery for both X-Plane 11 and MSFS. The brief blog provides the community with a glimpse into the sceneryâs progress and showcases new previews. According to the developers, they are trying to âintegrate and include as many details as possible, as well as some unique features never seen beforeâ, a process that will âtake way longer than expected sometimesâ. Therefore, at the current stage, it is impossible to estimate how much longer the team needs to complete the airport. From the previews accompanying the post, it is clear that the modeling for the passenger and cargo terminals, towers, and hangers are mostly complete. A few ground vehicles ranging from buses to pushback trucks are also showcased. In a previous post, the developers has revealed that the scenery will come with high quality PBR textures and custom animations for both simulators, promising to provide in-sim previews as soon as possible. Currently, the developers are yet to announce a release date or pricing for Frankfurt Airport. Based on Aviotekâs previous products, the scenery will likely cost between $18 and $26 USD. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Scenery developer Verticalsim has released the highly anticipated Myrtle Beach (KYMR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. This scenery is not just the airport of the South Carolina city but it comes with the surrounding hotels too. Being used as an army base until 1948, the city of Myrtle Beach decided there was not a need for an airport in the area, though funds were allocated. With the land being annexed in 1977, the property was used as a join civil-military airport, though it severely limited the number of civilian flights. Years later in 1996, the airport gained international status with new terminals with an influence from the local beaches. The airport served over 2.4 million passengers in 2018, being the second busiest airport in South Carolina. The product comes with many features that portray the quality work of Verticalsim. Starting off, the 2022 layout of the airport is included along with proper taxi signage. Custom jetways compatible with the SAM plugin are also a part of this package. Some hotels outside the airport grounds have been modeled to add extra depth to the surrounding area.Â  If you are interested in picking this visual rendition of Myrtle Beach for yourself, you can find over on the simMarket store, and sells for $13.87. If you are interested in other various scenery packages developed my Verticalsim, you can check out their website to view the assortment of sceneries for XP11 and MSFS.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Last week, aircraft developer Indiafoxtecho published a lengthy post on its Facebook page to announce new projects and bring development updates on existing ones. First off, the developers confirmed that their next project will be the Tornado for Microsoft Flight Simulators. Both the IDS and IDS-MLU will be developed, with the legacy IDS serving as the baseline model. Additionally, the developers hinted that âthe GR1, ECR and possibly the ADV variantâ will also be developed, though the feasibility of an ADV variant will be dependent on the resources available to the team.  A few previews depicting the planeâs Â exterior modeling were also published with the post, though the developers warned that they were taken at preliminary stages of development and will be drastically improved later on.  	In addition to announcing the Tornado, the Indiafoxtecho also touched on the progress of their other products. According to the developers, the Aermacchi M346, which will use native MSFS FCS flight model, now has a completed HTML5/JS HUD , but is experiencing slight delays in texturing and system programming. The aircraft should be ready for beta testing in the coming weeks. As for the Eurofighter Typhoon, the developers has decided to model the plane from scratch since they are not satisfied with the commercial meshes and P3D model they originally planned to use as a starting point, a process that will take considerably more time to complete. Finally, the developers talked about bringing the teamâs projects to DCS. They revealed that DCS development entails much more work than that for other simulators, requiring extensive planning and research beforehand. Therefore, their DCS team is currently only focused on âbringing the MB.339â to the market. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aircraft developer GotFriends, known for their Gee Bee R3 Special, and upcoming Grumman F4F,Â have teasedÂ their forthcoming Mini-500 helicopter for the new simulator. The developer has not detailed the features of the rotorcraft yet but plans on keeping the community updated throughout the development process. On theÂ "Skoots" YouTube channel, it was mentioned that the team is implementing the AirlandFS helicopter physics engine. The rotorcraft will also deliver with Asobo's native model with CFD when it's possible to do so, accounting for the current SDK's limitations.Â Â The Mini-500 will also present with a few bold liveries. First produced in 1994, the Revolution Mini-500 is a kit helicopter featuring a Rotax 582 engine and has produced over 100 airworthy models. It contains a history with a poor safety record, with many component failures plaguing the design. It was a cheap alternative to other helicopters, such as the Robinson R22, as it featured an endurance of 3 hours and a 75mph cruise speed. GotFriends' Mini-500 doesn't have a release date yet, though it was mentioned that it would release sometime in 2022, but you can stay updated on their websiteÂ here.Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Robert Randazzo at PMDGÂ has updated the community regarding its development whereaboutsÂ surrounding its imminent Boeing 737 release. He reiterates that, even after the release, the plane is still due for some improvements and additional work, but the team is confident that the aircraft is in a "releasable" state. The project has been a long time in the making, having been announced within the same period as MSFS's release.Â  Not a Port! Randazzo has re-emphasized that the 737 for MSFS is not simply a port from the Prepar3D version. In his own words, "Microsoft Flight simulator, when it finally arrived, offered such a magnificent visual environment that it seemed we would be missing an opportunity to do something truly wonderful if we simply dragged the 737 as-is into the new environment and handed it off to you."Â  A Gentle Reminder The PMDG 737 for MSFS will release in six-week intervals following the -700s initial release. The MAX variants are included in the lineage of products, which will come "eventually." Also incoming for the new flightsim, albeit without any additional information or timeframe, is theÂ 777Â andÂ 747 for MSFS.Â Though, both products are on the backburner for the time being while the team releases the 737 variants.Â  Some General Hype PMDG believes that Microsoft Flight Simulator "is the best simulation platform that any of the development team has ever put a product into." The developers gawked at the aircraft's beauty and performance in the simulator. As you can imagine, the 737 will deliver with a customized autopilot, flight model, systems modeling, and sound environment. Following the release, the team will be active with accomodating bug reports, and they warned users that the Ops Center would be very busy with updates in the next few days. Final Words A quick reminder for those who purchased the NGXu for P3D, you will receive a $99.99 credit towards buying the MSFS 737 product line if you acquired the aircraft before December 31st, 2019. The PDMG 737 for MSFS will be released on May 9th, 2022, asÂ the team announced on their YouTube channel.Â Threshold will keep you updated regarding pricing and additional information at the release on Monday.Â </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aamir at Fenix SimulationsÂ has reappeared to mentionÂ that the A320 for MSFS is incoming and that he "expects everyone here to be flying the Fenix in days, not months." This message comes after a long hiatus from the team as they've focused their development resources on ensuring the aircraft comes out in due time.Â  Aamir mentioned that the plane's release is contingent on the status of the upcoming Sim Update 9 patch, which will determine whether the A320 is ready for release, depending on its effect on the aircraft's functionality. It's anticipated that the patch will be delivered to users between now and May 17th, the next World Update.Â  Fenix's A320 is arguably the most feature-rich airliner to be delivered to a simulator;Â the team has done a fantastic job documenting their progress and updating the community with blogsÂ that outline the features of the Airbus. The team's Discord is often the medium for communication; you canÂ join it hereÂ to become involved in the community. Though we have not received any additional information from the team, for the time being, we'll ensure to keep you updated when the Fenix team decides to publish more information regarding the release of the plane.Â  (just a little sidenote, the video embedded above is from previous updates and is not from any recent "developments", and we give thanks to BiologicalNanobot for providing the screenshot!)</summary>
