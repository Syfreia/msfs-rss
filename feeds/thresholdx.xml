    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FSDesigns has recently released their rendition of Jacksonville International Airport (KJAX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 6,500,000 passengers.  Jacksonville International was conceived as a replacement for Imeson Field, which has served Jacksonville since 1927. It was simply not big enough to handle the increased demand for air travel, and the runways could not be expanded due to terrain limitations.Â   Inaugurated in 1968, its growth could have been faster, with only two million passengers a year by 1982 (way below expectation). However, the 90s saw a massive increase, with the average hitting the 5 million mark. In 2000, they approved an expansion plan to rebuild the landside terminal, central square, main concessions area, and a parking area expansion.  In 2006, they rolled out the second phase of the expansion program, rebuilding concourses A and C, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills. The crisis of 2009 stopped any other ongoing expansion work, with the old Concourse B being demolished and only considered for rebuilding ten years later when the traffic figures were healthy again. The pandemic, though, halted that project, which should begin by the summer of 2023.  Itâs served by Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Silver Airways, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express. American, Delta, and Southwest hold most of the market share, with 20% each.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality 3D models, custom ground textures, an optimized terminal interior, an up-to-date airport layout, SAM jetways, 3D vegetation, dynamic night lighting, and custom wear and tear using the latest technology.  Itâs available onÂ the X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $19.99, requiring at least 1.26 GB of free hard disk space. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FeelThere Releases St. Louis International Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of St. Louis Lambert International Airport (KSTL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving metropolitan St. Louis with a yearly average of 13 million passengers.  Opened 100 years ago, St. Louis started its life as an airfield with the addition of hangars and a passenger terminal two years later, in 1925. In that same decade, it became one of the first airports to have an air traffic control system, although via flags instead of radio communication.  In 1928, it became one of the first municipally owned airports in the United States after the city paid 2 million dollars to Albert Bond Lambert, its owners, and one of the most famous precursors of aviation in St. Louis, being the first licensed pilot in the city and part of the leadership of the Missouri Aeronautical Society.  During World War 2, it became a manufacturing facility for McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Curtiss-Wright.  In the 1950s, the airport got a new passenger terminal to handle the increased air travel demand, costing 7.2 million dollars and bringing an innovative dome design that preceded JFK (New York) and CDG (Paris). By 1957, they had 44 weekday TWA departures, 24 from American Airlines, 16 from Delta, 14 from Ozark Airlines, 13 from Eastern Air Lines, six from Braniff, and two from Central.Â   In the 1970s, Missouri residents rejected a proposal to build a new airport in suburban Illinois. Later in that decade, the airport underwent a massive expansion project that expanded the runways, increased the number of gates to 81, and boosted its overall capacity.Â   Following the airline deregulation in 1978, the dominant forces at St. Louis were TWA with 36 routes and Ozark with 25, followed by American and Eastern with 17 and 12, respectively.Â   As a direct consequence of the deregulation, airlines adopted a hub model. St. Louis became one of TWA's hubs, flying people all over America and even across the ocean to London, Paris, and Frankfurt.Â   With the aviation crisis that followed 9/11, TWA ceased operations and got bought out by American, which couldn't afford to keep St. Louis as one of their hubs. Southwest preyed on that by boosting their daily departures and overall participation. Currently, they hold 61.40% of the passenger market share, followed by American Airlines (12%) and Delta Air Lines (7.70%).Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with over 60 custom buildings, custom animated jetways, custom night lighting, custom ground clutter, realistic terrain elevation, and high-resolution ground textures.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.07, requiring at least 685.08 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently uploaded a 14-minute video showcasing the sounds of their upcoming Fokker F28 Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a short-range jet airliner from the late 1960s. The video covers various sound examples, ranging from knobs to the engineâs scream on the take-off rollâminutes upon minutes of each and every sound an F28 produces. First flown in May 1967, the Fokker F28 was developed to compete with turboprop airliners, carrying the same amount of passengers but cruising faster and offering more straightforward operation based on American design methodologies.  Its development was aided by feedback from many of their F27 operators, mainly North Americans, hence the âAmericanisationâ of the F28 to make it sell even better on American soil. With 241 units built in total, Fokker made six variants of the F28 with different carrying capacities and lengths.  Thereâs still no information on pricing or a potential release date, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Ontario International Airport (KONT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of San Bernardino, Riverside, and Greater Los Angeles with a yearly average of 5 million passengers.  The airport was built in 1941 as an Army Air Corps aircraft training and operation base. After the war, it became a large storage, sale, and scrapping center for Army Air Forces aircraft.Â   Shortly after, in 1946, the airport was renamed from âOntario Municipal Airportâ to âOntario International Airportâ because of outgoing trans-pacific cargo flights. The first international passenger flight happened that same year, a Pacific Overseas Airlines flight from Shanghai to Ontario, inaugurating round-trip air passenger service between the United States and the Orient. Western Airlines began operating at the airport three years later, followed by Bonanza Air Lines in 1955.  A new terminal was opened in 1998, discontinuing the old terminals, which now function as the administration and the USO. There are 26 gates total, with 12 on T2 and 14 on T4. Terminal 2 hosts Alaska Airlines, Avianca El Salvador, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines, and Volaris. Terminal 4 hosts American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest.  Itâs a FedEx and UPS Airlines cargo hub, transporting cargo all over North America and Asia (UPS). Amazon Air, Ameriflight, Amerijet International, Asia Pacific Airlines, and Kalitta Air also serve it. Ontario International is the ninth-largest cargo airport in the United States.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom taxi signs, parallax, LOD optimization, realistic night lighting, custom jetways with gate numbers, and more.  Itâs available onÂ Verticalsimâs Shop for $19.99, requiring at least 2.16 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to Soarandskor for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MXI Design has recently released their rendition of Deauville-Normandie Airport (LFRG) Â for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the commune of Deauville in France with a yearly average of 160,000 passengers.  Inaugurated in 1931 by the initiative of EugÃ¨ne Collas (the mayor of Deauville back then), it initially served as a business airport, eventually opening up for tourist charter flights as time went by.  For a short while, it used to be considered a third airport for Paris, but the distance (two-hour drive) and the lack of transportation options made it unfeasible, and they quickly ruled it out.  In 1952, they built a cement runway, allowing it to handle more aircraft types. Seven years later, a control tower was built, along with a runway extension to 1,600 meters in 1961.  In 1971, a passenger terminal was inaugurated, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and making it more suitable for commercial flights.Â   Recently, the operator has decided to build a new terminal, scheduled to reach completion in late 2023, expanding its area from 1,750 to 3,800 square meters. The state will cover 95% of the total cost; the remainder will come from Deauville. They also intend to add a photovoltaic park nearby to reach completion between 2024-2027. â It's served on a seasonal basis by Aegean Airlines and Volotea. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detailed PBR models of the terminals and their respective interiors (built with performance in mind), custom taxiway signs, 3D passengers, custom ground textures, and custom night lighting.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.77, requiring at least 543.61 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BEAUTIFUL MODEL of the World and AmSim teamed up again to build a rendition of Daytona Beach International Airport (KDAB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, known for headquartering the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.  Daytona Beach was built in the 1930s on a 299-ha piece of land featuring two grass runways. Passenger service started in the same decade with Eastern Air Lines, followed by National Airlines a year later.Â   A little before World War 2, the airport got four paved runways, allowing for the operation of DC-2s and DC-3s. WW2 had the airport taken over by the US Navy, becoming the Naval Air Station Daytona Beach, followed by an extensive military construction effort. Many of the buildings were utilized by Embry-Riddle University after their move from Miami two decades later.  In 1992, a large terminal was built, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and transforming the old terminal into an international passenger terminal, followed by a final runway extension that sticks to this day.Â   As of mid-late 2021, the airport had 364,071 aircraft operations, with 62% corresponding to general aviation. The passenger figures sit at an average of 800,000 per year.Â   Itâs served by American Airlines (Charlotte), American Eagle (Charlotte), Avelo Airlines (to begin in June 2023), and Delta Air Lines (Atlanta).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings, high-resolution ground textures, landside buildings, a detailed terminal interior, and compatibility with FSLTL traffic.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $18.26, requiring at least 2.75 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to mtn_dude_ for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Mount Hotham Airport (YHOT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving a ski resort on Mount Hotham in southeastern Australia. Itâs the countryâs highest airport.  Privately owned, the airport was opened in 2000 after a $17 million investment and four years of extensive planning.Â   Itâs served by a single charter airline, Airly, flying from Bankstown and Essendon.Â   Orbxâs rendition portrays the airport as it were during its âgolden ageâ when domestic and regional services still served it (QantasLink canceled their service in 2011 because it was losing them a lot of money). It features custom ground textures, a high-detail terminal interior, custom vegetation, custom animation, airport-specific static aircraft, over a hundred custom assets, and full PBR texturing.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.88, requiring at least 1.94 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. DarkBlueScenery has recently released their rendition of Chubu Centrair International Airport (RJGG) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving the city of Nagoya with a yearly average of 12 million passengers.  Serving the third largest metropolitan area in the country, Centrair was built to alleviate traffic into the former Nagoya Airport (now Nagoya Airfield) and redirect some of the cargo shipments that were initially directed to Tokyo or Kansai.Â   Construction work started in late 2000, reaching completion five years later at 668 billion yen. With a single runway and 42 gates, it is divided between two terminals, one for the major carriers and the second one for budget airlines. There are plans to add two new runways: a parallel runway by 2027 and a runway on the airport's west side that would replace the current runway.  It's a hub for All Nippon Airways and Jetstar Japan and features a strong presence of Japan Airlines and Polar Air Cargo. The visitors' list includes Air Busan, Air China, Asiana Airlines, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, Cebu Pacific, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Etihad Airways, Jeju Air, Korean Air, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and United Airlines.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a realistic 3D model of the passenger terminals, custom ground service equipment, performance-friendly optimization, and more. The developer recommends using X-Plane 12 to have the best experience possible.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.28, requiring at least 492.42 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Boundless Announces Faro Airport for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12</title>
    <updated>2023-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/648af08ab0876993343dde1b_faro1.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="174573"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently announced their next project for X-Plane 11 and 12: a rendition of Faro International Airport (LPFR), serving the city of Faro in Algarve, Portugal, with a yearly average of 8 million passengers. It was inaugurated in 1965 by then president AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s, with a government-owned DC-3 being the first airplane ever to touch its runway, followed by TAP Air Portugalâs Lockheed Super Constellation, transporting government officials and important guests. Scheduled passenger service started two days after, connecting Faro to Lisbon. In that same year, the airport recorded 58,000 passengers. Faro has only seen two significant developments in its first 40 years: a new passenger terminal building in 1989, and its eventual enlargement in 2001, to cope with the increased demands for air travel. The 2010s brought even more pressure for expansion, which reached completion in 2013 after a two-phase work, increasing its passenger handling capacity from six million to eight million passengers. Minor expansion work went on over the remainder of the decade, with the airport now able to handle up to 9 million passengers a year, with 22 stands and 36 boarding gates.  Itâs a base for EasyJet and Ryanair, flying to many European destinations. The visitorsâ list includes many traditional European airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Scandinavian, and TAP Air Portugal and popular low-cost carriers such as Condor, Eurowings, Jet2, Smartwings, and Wizz Air. Thereâs no release date or pricing information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>
