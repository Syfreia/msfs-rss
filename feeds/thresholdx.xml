    <title>xEnviro 1.17 Released</title>
    <updated>2022-10-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xenviro" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6341d241a7d2d7f0c45ac29b_1.PNG" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="348608"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. After an extended development time due to real-world circumstances, The team behind xEnviro have finally released their latest version of the product, update 1.17. Containing loads of new features and updates to the weather add-on. â â The team at behind the project have worked really hard to get this new version of xEnviro to everyone, considering what happened with some of the developers in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine. This update is rather major compared to the recent version 1.16, and contains an overall new look and major changes to the already robust weather plugin. The team will also continue to update this plugin as long as they deem necessary and worthwhile for the people who still use X-Plane 11. â From the extensive forum post project leader Magnus Lorvik made about the update, the post mentions the hurdles and limitations when it comes to bringing the plugin into the newly released X-Plane 12 Early Access, as well as the major updates 1.17 brings to the table. â âX-Plane 12 Sadly, there is some bad news. Laminar Research have turned down the idea of bringing xEnviro into their newly released simulator X-Plane 12 due to reasoning that the team at Threshold cannot understand and find somewhat puzzling. There have been ongoing arguments and conflict issues with Laminar Research attempting to bring xEnviro to X-Plane 12, but as the Executive states âWeâre tired of fighting and hopelessly defending long development cyclesâ. This is not just us that are having difficulties coming to terms with Laminar Research, Developers Enhanced Skyskapes, SkyMaxx and others are also experiencing the same issue.Â  â VR Compatibility Threshold has made a main change to xEnviro in version 1.17 by basing it on a spherical buffer. This has allowed them to get a much better performance for lower end machines and higher screen resolutions. Higher end machines also benefit, but not as much. VR is only compatible currently with Vulkan. â 1:1 Scale The team at Threshold have made a main objective to make a true to life representation of the environment as possible and thus we recreate the atmosphere in 1:1 scale. This differs to other clouds in MSFS and X-Plane 12 as xEnviro gives a true positioning awareness when relating to your surroundings in the sky. An example of this is when you fly between two layers of clouds that are close to each other. While in MSFS and X-Plane 12 you get claustrophobic in a 5000 feet gap, you will perceive this as a grand space in xEnviro. â Some Known Issues The 1:1 scale has its demands on performance. The main compromising issue in 1.17 is obvious when you load into the sim. Movement shimmer. This is not a huge problem when you fly slow and are gone when standing still. The artefacts are especially noticeable around the edges of the clouds. We have added a quality slider to reduce that shimmer - but at the cost of performance. This will be a continuous target to refine and improve for us going forward.Â  â â 1.17 Changelog â Added â Changed â Removed Known issues â If you are a current owner of xEnviro, this update will be free to obtain by heading over to the X-Plane.org Store or the Threshold Store and downloading the latest version. If you are still an X-Plane 11 user and would like to purchase this addon, you can purchase it through both the X-Plane Store for $69.90 or the Threshold Store for $69.69. â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Drops New Updates on Current Projects for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/90t7ef" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After an extended period of silence, Robert Randazzo has dropped a new update detailing the final piece that complete the 737 NG family in MSFS, We know that we can expect the final aircraft from the 737 fleet, the 737-900, at some point during November unless they find more obstacles along the way. It is approaching the beta testing phase which has been hindered due to the uncovering a few issues, causing PMDG to push the Beta test date back. As part of the update, we got to take a look at the newly developed EFB for all of the Boeing fleet that should hopefully be with us soon! This new addition could massively enhance users' experience within the Simulator to make a more realistic flight. The EFB will allow for better performance computations, analysis, weight/balance, etc. It will also enable the use of Navigraph and SimBrief inside of the aircraft. Unfortunately, as it is a quick preview, weâre still in the dark with any potential roll-out of the EFB feature to be here with us to be used in MSFS. The update has also touched-base with some new updates regarding the development for the Xbox side and things are looking rather promising. The team is currently awaiting further news from Asobo/MS as they are still working on compatibility for C++/WASM projects on the Xbox platform. Once this has been completed, then PMDG will release the DC-6 for Xbox first, to ensure everything works smoothly before making the 737 fleet available on the platform. As a final note from the update, Randazzo has dropped some new information regarding their next product to be ported to MSFS. We have been told that the development of the 777 has seen a massive amount of progress since the last update and they seem to be running more ahead than they thought! Their plan is to use a more worn, mid-aged 777 cockpit to replicate rather than a brand new one as the 737âs are. This should overall give a far better unique look to the 777 and enhance the visuals for the people who will fly this aircraft. Robert stated himself âWait until you see it- it is spectacular!â. Thatâs all for the info-drop from PMDG, If you are interested in the other aircraft PMDG currently have released then head over to the PMDG website. For MSFS they currently have released the DC-6 and all the 737 aircraft apart from the -900 Variant.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Spaceport America (9NM9) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, an FAA-licensed spaceport in New Mexico (United States) for vertical and horizontal launch space vehicles, launched in 2011 and deemed ready for operations in 2019.Â  Owned and operated by the State of New Mexico, it is the first purpose-built commercial spaceport, focusing solely on commercial operations. Itâs home to companies such as HAPSMobile and SpinLaunch, and a hub for Virgin Galactic, Up Aerospace, and Exos Aerospace.Â  Its concept was first introduced in 1990 by Dr. Burton Lee, a Stanford University engineering lecturer. Responsible for writing the initial business and strategy plans, he secured 1.4 million dollars in seed funding, aided by Senator Pete Domenici. In 1992, they formed the Southwest Space Task Force, focusing on advancing New Mexicoâs space industryÂ  infrastructure and activity-wise. After lots of research, they chose a 70 square kilometer plot of state-owned land, near Las Cruces, to build the spaceport. In 2003, the Economic Development Cabinet Secretary Rick Homans presented the idea to Governor Bill Richardson, which then reached an agreement with Sir Richard Branson from Virgin to make New Mexico the headquarters for Virgin Galactic and consequently facilitate it for the state laws to be enacted and authorize the construction of the airport.Â  The scenery was built with PBR textures, accurately replicating the real-life counterpart as it looks in 2022.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight have released a new development update on their upcoming RJ Professional series. Announced officially on the 15th of August 2022, the RJ professional line is set to be a more modern and streamlined version of their previous â146 Professionalâ addon. Differences include slightly larger and more powerful engines, but the most significant difference comes in the flight deck! The RJ professional line will boast an all-new EFIS system replacing the traditional analogue ADI, HSI and engine instruments.Â  In providing an update on the development process, JustFlight has said: âThe interior and cockpit modelling and texturing has been undergoing extensive testing in recent weeks, with every rivet, screw and label being compared to its real-life counterpart, to ensure 100% accuracy. After spending many months developing the 146, itâs been interesting to see just how much was improved and upgraded in the later RJ, and how all come together to reduce pilot workload without losing the appeal of the aircraft.â JustFlight has informed us that throughout the cockpit the majority of instruments are now âaliveâ and being fine-tuned. The other significant bit of work to take place has been the development of over 30 different true-to-life liveries which will be released with the aircraft!Â  To read more from JustFlight's latest RJ development update click here! â</summary>
