    <summary>Sim: MSFS. âFenix Simulations announced the news of the much-anticipated Block Two update of their A320 aircraft via Discord. Fenix's Project manager, Aamir, provided details and progress of the remodeling and improvement of the external model. The team has been working hard to get the update out as soon and smoothly as possible.Â  Aamir further enlightens us on the changes to the artwork side of the project. They are still working on moving textures and remaining decals to their new workflow. The team shared images of the recent model highlighting improvements in texturing window modeling and other noticeable details. According to the Discord post, the windows now match more accurately to the interiors, giving a greater sense of depth. The team also worked heavily on improving access panels, doors, and latches, with 3D modeling of their physical shapes. These details are further completed with textures highlighting the dirt and grime that build up over time. The landing gear is another critical rebuild mentioned, taking four months to complete. The improvement over V1's landing gear is night and day. New attention to details like hydraulic lines, tensioning springs, actuators, and fasteners are major improvement areas.Â  The team highlighted many further details by modeling every panel and seam throughout the bird. The overall shape is noted as an improvement, showing a three-quarters overhead shot. This shot shows off the improved modeling and accuracy matching closer to the real-world counterpart. According to Aamir, V2 will consume much less VRAM, even with enhanced modeling and details. V2 will run much better than V1 now, stating, "It feels like voodoo.". The delay was unexpected, but the Fenix's continues to work on making this version a completely new experience. Aamir thanks the community for "for sticking with us through the bumps in the roads."

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Bruno Reichert has recently released their rendition of Brasilia - President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR), the third busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. â It was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. â A proper terminal building was inaugurated in 1971, designed by TÃ©rcio Fontana Pacheco, a Brazilian Air Force architect. â The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more, divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. â New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. â Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed custom terminals and hangars, custom ground textures, custom night lighting, PBR texturing, correct runway slope, custom terraforming, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Microsoft Flight Simulator releases the Mitsubishi MU2 as its Famous Flyer 7! The MU2 is now available for FS2020. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries built the MU2, a high-performing turboprop that is primarily used in general aviation and some military operations. It first took flight on September 14th, 1963, and over 700 have been built so far! The MU2 filled the gap in the corporate aviation market for an economical, fast turboprop with state-of-the-art engines.Â  Powered by TPE331-6251 Engines, the MU2 typically cruises at FL250 and reaches around 260 knots with a range of 1,450 miles. This version of the MU2 has a seating capacity of four in the rear and has a fully pressurized cabin. It has a service ceiling of 29,590 feet, allowing you to fly above most weather conditions. MU2 also has de-icing equipment and ice detections for flight into known icing conditions. Although equipped with such equipment, the MU2 has a unique ice build-up pattern to keep in mind. Mitsubishi unconventionally designed the MU2's wing with double-slotted Fowler flaps running the length of the entire wingspan for STOL performance. That design choice canceled out room for conventional ailerons; instead, Mitsubishi went with roll spoilers for roll control. Roll spoilers retain positive control during slow flight without being subjected to aileron snap, delivering smoother operation during rollouts and turbulence. The decision for roll spoilers gives the Mu2 its infamous flight characteristics.Â  The MU2 aircraft was built with sturdy and durable landing gear, making it capable of short, non-paved airstrips ops. The Mu2 gets you above the weather and at high speeds. With its STOL abilities, you can choose from a wide variety of landing options. You can now purchase it for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 at a price of $14.99 from the Marketplace.Â  â As always make sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Taimodels has recently released their rendition of Cairns Airport (YBCS) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving the city of Cairns in Queensland, Australia, with a yearly average of 5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1936 on 162 hectares of land bought by the Cairns City Council, originally sporting three runways made of cinders, red earth, weathered rock, and sand. Then, in the early 1940s, the Australian Government purchased the airport to adapt it for RAF use, paving and lengthening the main runway to comport larger aircraft. â  Twenty years later, the airport was upgraded to receive jet aircraft, with an expansion and a runway extension followed by extensive flattening. â With the ever-growing passenger traffic figures, there was pressure in the late 1970s to expand the passenger terminal, which went on to happen in 1982. Finished two years later, it was just the first stage of three. The whole ordeal ended in 1997 with the conclusion of a three-story Airport Administration Center. â In 2007, the domestic terminal was redeveloped, costing the administration around 200 million Australian Dollars.Â  â The last upgrade started in 2019 and was completed a year later, increasing the departure hall area and adding dining and retail facilities. Itâs part of their plan to prepare the airport for handling up to 6 million passengers annually from 2027. â In early 2023, they announced the first major upgrade to the international terminal, rolling out in stages to minimize passenger disruption.  â Itâs a hub for QantasLink and Skytrans Airlines and served by Air New Zealand, Air Niugini, Airnorth, Alliance Airlines, Asia Pacific Airlines, Bonza, Hinterland Aviation, Jetstar, PNG Air, Qantas, Rex Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Virgin Australia. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail models, SAM jetways, PBR texturing, custom autogen, ground traffic plugins, and weather textures (XP12).Â  â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.18, requiring at least 1.51 GB of free hard disk space to install.

Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Jacksonville International Airport (KJAX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 6,500,000 passengers.  Jacksonville International was conceived as a replacement for Imeson Field, which has served Jacksonville since 1927. It was simply not big enough to handle the increased demand for air travel, and the runways could not be expanded due to terrain limitations.Â  â The airport's growth could have been faster, with only two million passengers annually by 1982 (way below expectation). However, the 90s saw a massive increase, with the average hitting the 5 million mark. In 2000, they approved an expansion plan to rebuild the landside terminal, central square, main concessions area, and a parking area expansion. â In 2006, they rolled out the second phase of the expansion program, rebuilding concourses A and C, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills. The crisis of 2009 stopped any other ongoing expansion work, with the old Concourse B being demolished and only considered for rebuilding ten years later when the traffic figures were healthy again. The pandemic, though, halted that project. â Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Silver Airways, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. American, Delta, and Southwest hold most of the market share, with 20% each. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom lighting, high-detail models, and performance-friendly optimization.  â It's available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $17.78, requiring at least 5.89 GB of free hard disk space to install.

Generally speaking, we build in 5+ years of development/features and improvements into every product we sell- and this is true of our new product lines in Microsoft Flight Simulator as well!â. He then concluded: âThe tablet is part-and-parcel of that development philosophy. In the post release period of any PMDG product you can expect to see a rapid iteration of changes/fixes/features. Over time that iteration cycle will slow from weekly to monthly to quarterly, depending upon the backlog of features that we have for youâ. â â The update is available now for PMDG.com customers, and the marketplace release will depend on Microsoftâs intake process.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>
