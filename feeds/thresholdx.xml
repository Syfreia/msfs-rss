    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently announced their rendition of London City Airport (EGLC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fifth busiest airport in London with a yearly average of 5 million passengers. First proposed in 1981, the airport only came to be in 1987, after years of bureaucratic slowdowns. Work didnât start until 1986 when they got the permission to begin constructing. For the first couple of years of operation, the airport only had a 1,080-meter-long runway with a 7.5-degree glide path slope, limiting it to a select range of aircraft like the Dash 7 and the Dornier 228. It wasnât long until the airport submitted a request to extend the runway, making the glide path slightly less steep and thus allowing for an increased aircraft variety. Approval for the extension came in 1992, making the runway reach its current 1,508 meters of length, and the glide path was slightly reduced from 7.5 to 5.5, allowing even more aircraft to operate at the airport.  The airport is mainly served by British Airways, with many intra-European destinations such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, and ZÃ¼rich. The visitorsâ list includes ITA Airways, KLM, Loganair, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Luxair, and Swiss International Air Lines. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings, a high-detail depiction of the airport terminal and its interior, landside details, custom ground clutter, and 3D people. It will be available on Tuesday (May 4th) for roughly $18.85 (14.99 pounds).Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimWorks Studios have recently released a progress update on the development of their upcoming Pilatus PC12 for MSFS. The aircraft is expected to be a highly detailed recreation of the PC12 and from what we have seen so far, this looks to be holding true.Â  The progress report starts out with âThe exterior model is now complete and we are finalizing the base materials and pumping out liveries. What is left to do on the exterior is finalise the flap animations, chocks &amp; reds. We are thinking also of animating the de-icing boots, but that will also require some effects work, so it is under consideration. The last thing will be the decals pass, where we will apply the rivets and stencils to the aircraftâÂ  There has been some confusion among keen customers and members of the sim aviation community with the first part of the announcement, SimWorks studios from the beginning have pushed the upcoming pc12 as an in-depth aircraft, but in the latest post we see them debating as to whether the de-ice boots will be animated or not, many believe this is basic and should be without a doubt included for any in-depth recreation.Â  The details of the post go on to sadly explain why the project is behind schedule and that it will continue to fall behind schedule for the time being as developers need more hours in the project. We are informed that the initial release will be around the margin of $25-$35 but unfortunately will lack some features that will not be seen until subsequent updates, these features include A weather radar, 5 bladed propeller and the SWS tablet.Â  We will keep the community informed on this project as it goes through its development. </summary>

    <title>Paulo Ricardo Releases Viracopos International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Paulo Ricardo has recently released his rendition of Viracopos International Airport (SBKP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo state, in Brazil. It's the fourth busiest airport in the country, with a yearly average of 11,845,500 passengers. The airport originated from a small airfield built in 1932 during the Constitutionalist Revolution in Sao Paulo. Then, in the 1950s, it started as a cargo airport, which is still one of its main roles today.   In the 1960s, it was Sao Paulo's international airport because Guarulhos did not exist yet, and Congonhas (SBSP) didn't have a long enough runway to accommodate international jet planes. The distance (100km) quickly became an issue, as people would fly to Rio de Janeiro - GaleÃ£o instead and then take a connecting flight to Congonhas. As a curiosity, it even showed up in the Guinness Book during that time as the furthest airport from the city it claimed to serve. It was Sao Paulo's international airport for nearly 25 years until Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) was constructed. Losing the "crown" didn't mean it would be forgotten and left to rot, with Infraero investing millions in improving the airport's infrastructure for passengers and cargo. It was divided into three steps, the first completed in 2004, with the construction of new passenger lounges and a new cargo terminal. The second step, in 2005, expanded the passenger terminal and built a control tower. The third phase, which consists of constructing a second runway, still has yet to happen. â It's a popular alternate airport to Rio de Janeiro-GaleÃ£o and both Congonhas and Guarulhos in Sao Paulo because it hardly closes due to adverse weather conditions.  Viracopos is the second busiest cargo airport in the country, with 77,000 square meters of cargo terminals, 1,700 square meters for animal cargo, and 1,480 cubic meters of refrigerated space.  â The airport is the hub for Azul Brazilian Airlines, covering a huge domestic network and a couple of international routes. GOL Transportes AÃ©reos, one of the biggest South American LCCs, offers five domestic routes from VCP. On the cargo side, it hosts Azul Cargo and LATAM Cargo.  The scenery features a highly accurate rendition of the airport and the surrounding city (Campinas), with a fully modeled passenger terminal and its interior, custom ground markings, landside buildings, custom ground clutter, custom night lighting, a realistic depiction of the internal layout with all of the shops as per real life, multiple POIs, and more. It's available on the MSFS Marketplace for roughly $15.99, requiring at least 4.70 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Robert Randazzo, PMDGâs founder, has recently published aÂ development updateÂ on their forum regarding future updates for the 737 lineup and its potential Xbox release, the Universal Flight Tablet, the 777, and more.Â   Robert begins with information on an upcoming update for the 737 lineup. He claims they are refactoring some of the click-controls and animation logic to better conform with the new SDK standards, which differ from what it used to be back in 2020 when the aircraft was still under development. They managed to preserve all functionality on PC while also functioning identically on Xbox. They have also been refining AFDS roll control logic, improving magenta line computations, and continuing with the preparations to make the navdata system compatible with the new Navigraph database format.  With some of the aforementioned improvements, a new update is coming soon for the 737s. It will be available in the PMDG Operations Center for people who bought it directly via their website and a week later on the Marketplace (they state itâs hard to predict how long that will take, so itâs just an assumption).  PMDG claims to be âhappyâ with the 737 on Xbox, although holding off on releasing it just yet because they have not gained clarity on the timeline for the associated livery packages available in the Marketplace for use by Xbox customers. They are using the DC-6 as a gauge for how long it takes, and it appears to move through the process substantially slower than the aircraft itself. They intend to fully understand the timeline before releasing the aircraft. On that livery package note, they state that even though the original plan was to make it free of charge, the Marketplace has a minimum pricing of $4.99 per item, which will be the cost of each livery package, through no fault of their own.  The Universal Flight Tablet is said to be robust and ready for wide-scale testing after the developers had to fight an issue involving C++/WASM and their capabilities of sending/receiving data from the sim to the outside world. They donât have a release timeline yet, but they say Navigraph/SimBrief users will be pleased with the UFT once itâs out.  The DC-6, on the other hand, also underwent heavy work to ensure proper compatibility with the Xbox, including changes to the shape/function of some clickable surfaces to facilitate their use on consoles. The changes are currently being tested; they claim it should be out late next week. PC users will also get the update, but itâs said to be âtransparent,â given it targets Xbox folk.  They finish with information on the 777, saying âwork is progressing nicelyâ and that the âpieces are coming together in a polished form.â Although they do not plan to show any in-development shots yet, they have claimed itâs âyielding some absolutely spectacular resultsâ and that their development process has matured significantly since 2020. They promise that the wait and their silence will be paid off with great joy.  The 737 Lineup and the DC-6 are available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ and in the MSFS Marketplace (partially).Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Bellingham International Airport (KBLI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the third largest commercial airport in Washington with a yearly average of 316,693 passengers as of 2022.  The airportâs history dates back to October 1936, when the construction work began under the supervision of the WPA (Works Progress Administration), which had previously funded the purchase of the airportâs 200 acres of land from Charles F. Larrabee. Initially, there were plans for three runways, but only one was built, with 1,100 meters of length and 46 meters of width.Â   The US Army Corps of Engineers took over the entire project in 1940, expanding the airport to three full runways and building a basic infrastructure to operate as an airport. It was opened to the public a year later and then seized by theÂ US Army not long after, following the Pearl Harbor attacks.Â   During World War 2, Bellingham International was utilized by the Fourth Air Force to provide an aerial defense to the Pacific Coast and later on for ferrying aircraft to Alaska for its subsequent transfer to the Soviet Union.  Post-war, the facility was closed and handed back to Whatcom County, slowly redeveloped as a civilian airport with a terminal designed by F. Stanley Piper. High costs led Whatcom County to sell it to the Port of Bellingham in 1957 for 1 dollar. The new owners were not fond of the high expenses either, only resurfacing one of the runways (16/34), which is still the sole runway in operation.  In 2010, the runway was resurfaced to accommodate Allegiant Airâs Boeing 757s on their nonstop service to Hawaii.Â   The terminal saw upgrades in 1980 with a two-phase project and a 38 million-dollar expansion in the early 2010s, increasing the number of gates and the general terminal area from 27,500 square feet to 104,000 square feet.Â   Bellingham is served by four airlines: Alaska Airlines (Seattle-Tacoma), Allegiant Air (Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Oakland, Palm Springs, Phoenix/Mesa, San Diego), San Juan Airlines (Eastsound, Friday Harbor, Lopez, Point Roberts), and Southwest Airlines (Las Vegas, Oakland).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of BLI, with an updated ground layout, custom ground markings, a terminal interior, and more.  Itâs available onÂ FlightSim.toÂ for roughly $10.99, requiring at least 470.91 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Onfinal Studio has recently released their rendition of Kirkenes Airport (ENKR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 35th busiest airport in Scandinavia with a yearly average of 247,107 passengers.  Built as a military air station in WW2 and briefly operated as a civilian airport right after the war until its abandonment in 1948, it wasn't until 1963 that it would be reopened with a new terminal and an extended runway, where SAS and Finnair reigned supreme for nearly the entire decade until Wideroe and Norving followed suit.  In 1990, the airport underwent a major renovation and expansion, which included constructing a new terminal building, an extended runway, and modernized facilities for passengers and aircraft. The airport continued to grow and develop throughout the 1990s and 2000s, with additional upgrades and expansions to keep pace with the increasing demand for air travel in the region.  Kirkenes Airport has a single terminal building that houses all of the airport's facilities, including check-in counters, baggage handling, security, and boarding gates. The terminal is relatively small but modern and well-equipped with amenities such as a restaurant, a cafÃ©, a duty-free shop, and a souvenir store.  Itâs served by Norwegian Air Shuttle (Oslo, Tromso), Scandinavian Airlines (Oslo), and WiderÃ¸e (Alta, BÃ¥tsfjord, BerlevÃ¥g, Hammerfest, HonningsvÃ¥g, Mehamn, SÃ¸rkjosen, TromsÃ¸, VadsÃ¸, VardÃ¸).Â   The scenery features a high-detail rendition of the airport, with accurate 3D models of all buildings, custom-made objects placed around the area, PBR textures, and night lighting. It also features the current runway dimensions. Furthermore, the terrain around the airport was corrected to more accurately resemble the real counterpart.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.15, requiring at least 355.71 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of London City Airport (EGLC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fifth busiest airport in London with a yearly average of 5 million passengers.  Inaugurated in 1987, after years of bureaucratic slowdowns and with construction work only starting a year before, it originally had 1080 meters of runway and a glide path angle of 7.5 degrees, severely limiting the aircraft options that could fly into the airport. It took only a short time until they needed to extend the runway to accommodate more aircraft.  The extension came a few years later, in 1992, increasing it to a total of 1,508 meters, and reducing the glide path angle to 5.5 degrees, making it "compatible" with more aircraft, thus, attracting more airlines to operate at the airport.  The airport is mainly served by British Airways, with many intra-European destinations such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, and ZÃ¼rich. The visitors' list includes ITA Airways, KLM, Loganair, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Luxair, and Swiss International Air Lines.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with detailed buildings, realistic ground markings, high-resolution ground imagery, night lighting, highly detailed airport vehicles, performance-friendly optimization, custom vegetation, PBR materials, static aircraft, and optional trains.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ andÂ UK2000 StoreÂ for roughly $15.45, requiring at least 53.17 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Rotate recently released their rendition of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 for X-Plane 12 under a beta program.  The MD-80 Pro for X-Plane 12 aims to deliver a precise flight model and fine-tuned engine performance, developed with advice and counseling from real MD-80 pilots.  The features include a custom flight management system with SIDs and STARs, custom LNAV and VNAV, take-off and approach speed management, custom navigation display, complete HOLD functionality with entry pattern calculation and present POS, a detailed simulation of systems with WX/TCAS, an accurate PW-JT8D-219 model with its intricacies, advanced electrical and hydraulics systems, and realistic visuals with PBR texturing, accurate animations, rain and ice windshield effects, VR compatibility, and custom sounds.  The MD-80 is a twin-engine, medium-range jet airliner designed and manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. It was first introduced in 1980 and quickly became a popular choice for airlines worldwide due to its fuel efficiency and reliability. It was a shortened version of the earlier DC-9 airliner, which had been in production since the 1960s. McDonnell Douglas updated the design of the DC-9, incorporating more modern technology, such as advanced avionics and more efficient engines, to create the MD-80.  Despite its popularity, its production eventually ended in 1999 when Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas. However, many MD-80s are still in service today, particularly in countries with developing aviation industries.  Itâs available onÂ X-Plane.OrgÂ for $59.95. Owners of the X-Plane 11 version are entitled to a discounted upgrade ($24.95).Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. AG Sim has recently released their rendition of Burgas Airport (LBBG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 2nd busiest airport in Bulgaria with a yearly average of 2,885,000 passengers. The first landing strip was built in 1912 by the Bulgarian Army during the Balkan War. This airfield was used for military purposes during World War I and II. After the war ended, it was also used for civilian purposes. â In the 1960s, a new modern airport was built on the old airfield site, officially opened in 1970. The airport had a single runway and a small terminal building at the time. It served as an essential transportation hub for Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, and it played a significant role in the country's tourism industry. During the 1980s and 1990s, the airport underwent significant renovations and expansions, including the construction of a new terminal building, a second runway, and improved navigation and air traffic control systems. These upgrades allowed the airport to accommodate larger aircraft and more passengers, becoming a major gateway to the country for tourists from all over Europe. In the 2000s, the airport continued to expand and modernize. In 2013, a new terminal building was opened, increasing the airport's capacity to more than 2.7 million passengers annually.  The airport's traffic is primarily seasonal, with many airlines coming over to visit during the summer: Aer Lingus, airBaltic, BH Air, Bluebird Airways, Bulgaria Air, Buzz, Corendon Dutch Airlines, easyJet, Enter Air, European Air Charter, Eurowings, Freebird Airlines Europe, GetJet Airlines, Jet Time, Jet2.com, LOT Polish Airlines, Luxair, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, SkyUp, SmartLynx Airlines, Smartwings, Sunclass Airlines, Sundair, TUI Airways, TUI fly Belgium, TUI fly Netherlands, TUI fly Nordic, Windrose Airlines, and Wizzair (the only one with a year-long route to London Luton). The scenery accurately represents the airport's terminal, runway, taxiways, and surroundings, with custom ground textures, PBR materials, dynamic apron objects, and realistic night lighting.  It's available on SimMarket for roughly $15.49, requiring at least 1.60GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>S-Design Releases FlorÃ¸ Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. S-Design has recently released their rendition of FlorÃ¸ Airport (ENFL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the town of FlorÃ¸ in Vestland, Norway. The yearly average sits at around 200,000 passengers as of 2014.  The airport opened in 1971 with three other regional airports in Norway. Back then, it was served by Wideroe with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters until 1994, when Coast Air took over. Danish Air Transport took over briefly between 2003 and 2012 when Wideroe made their glorious return.Â   Avinor, the airport owner, has plans to eventually expand the airport, which still uses its first terminal from 1971, considered small by todayâs standards. They also consider a potential runway extension from 1,700m to 2,000 meters, allowing bigger aircraft to operate at the airport. The major implication, though, would be the cost: 200 million kroner, and the amount of work it would imply, as it would require lots of flattening and landfilling.Â   It is served by three airlines: Bristow Helicopters (Deepsea Stavanger, GjÃ¸a, Snorre A and B, Visund), DAT (Oslo), and WiderÃ¸e (Bergen).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-definition hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, 20cm aerial imagery, highly detailed models of all airport buildings, and 4K PBR texturing.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.17, requiring at least 621.32MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!  Â   â</summary>
