    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Golden Key Studio (also known as GKS) have released their rendition of the F-111E Ardvark for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The release comes just days after the most recent update on the projectâs development.  Originally developed by General Dynamics in the early 60's, the F-111E, nicknamed the Aardvark, was a pioneer for the development of features that would become a staple of modern combat aircraft. The Ardvark was the first production aircraft to feature variable-sweep wings. The platform also played a pivotal role in the design of modern after-burning engines. The Aardvark first entered service with the USAF in 1967, and the Australian government later purchased the E variant of the F-111. While the RAAF only ever deployed their F-111s as a deterrent, the USAF flew over 4000 combat missions in both the Vietnam and Gulf Wars. The USAF retired their F-111s in 1996 while the RAAF had theirs in active service until 2010.  âGKS promises users of the F-111 will experience an authentic flight model with impressive graphics and a highly detailed cockpit featuring accurate aircraft systems. GKS has kept the development of the Ardvark pretty quiet overall, and while there isnât a ton of information available on their latest offering it is expected that it will be up to the same standard as their MiG-21.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published anotherÂ development updateÂ with further information on their upcoming Boeing 777 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, along with four new screenshots showcasing its external model.  Randazzo strongly emphasizes the modeling work placed on the triple seven, with accurate color distortions according to the viewing angle, visible and detailed rivets, and surface irregularities around the joints of the radome and the forward gear doors.Â  â  The tail area also brings great detail, with visibly different looks between the surfaces made of carbon fiber and aluminum.Â  â  They also report their upcoming product performs almost the same as their 737 lineup, meaning it wonât be particularly demanding despite the alleged 3D model improvements.Â   The fly-by-wire simulation, with its control laws and inherent oddities, is said to be accurately represented. Failures will be a possibility, too.  Itâs still undergoing beta testing, with more than 200 reports so far during the first phase of testing, half of which were already fixed, according to Randazzo.Â   More previews will be shared with the community in the days and weeks ahead, and they seem âhappy with the pace and character of the testing they have been doing thus far.â  Thereâs no pricing or release date information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Rafael NÃºÃ±ez International Airport (SKCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Cartagena, Colombia, with a yearly average of 7.2 million passengers.  It was built in 1946 as Crespo Air Field, with TACA Colombia being the first airline to serve the city, albeit very briefly, as they went under a year later, with LANSA taking the remaining slots.  By 1979, the airport averaged around 99 flights a week, which was not enough in terms of touristic volume for the local hotels, leading to pressure for an airport redevelopment in 1982: a new passenger terminal and a runway extension, allowing for bigger aircraft. It is now the fourth busiest airport in the country.  Itâs a hub for Avianca and served by Air Century, American Airlines, Arajet, Avianca Costa Rica, Clic, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Edelweiss Air, JetBlue, KLM, Latam Colombia, Latam Peru, Spirit, Wingo.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, high-detail buildings, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.37, requiring at least 1.21 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Kiss Simulation has recently released their rendition of Sarajevo International Airport (LQSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers.  It was built in 1966 and opened for traffic three years later, although domestically. International operations only started a year later, with Frankfurt being its first international destination.Â   The first renovation happened nearly 20 years later for the 1984 Winter Olympics, with a new terminal building, a runway extension, and navigational system improvements.  The terminal was expanded in 2017, with a new 10,000-square-meter building able to handle up to 2 million passengers a year.  Its mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather have led to multiple financial losses over the years, with the most memorable one dating back to December 2015, when over 40% of the flights were canceled. The only way they could fix it would be by moving the threshold an additional 200 meters, which would shorten the runway, which is not ideal given that itâs already relatively short at 2,600 meters.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with the new terminal extension, custom runway profile, real-world ILS profile, custom-made ground textures, up-to-date ground layout, runway weathering, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.18, requiring at least 792.15 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cockspur has announced the release of their PH100 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Known for their light business jets and general aviation aircraft in MSFS, Cockspur has now unveiled the PH100, an rendition of the Embraer Phenom 100. Their recent release of the Cessna Citation Mustang garnered popularity from the Microsoft Flight Simulator community, and anticipation for the PH100 has been building steadily. This project started as a side endeavor right after the Mustang release but was kept under wraps until an intriguing teaser trailer was unveiled in early December 2022. Recent beta testing, marked by live streams offering glimpses of the development progress and features, has further stoked the excitement. The PH100 has become one of the most eagerly awaited aircraft in the MSFS community, with Cockspur teasing its release date via their Facebook page just this week. In the real world, the Embraer Phenom 100 is a significant player in the corporate jet market. Manufactured by the renowned Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer, the Phenom 100 is classified as a VLJ (Very Light Jet), with its larger sibling being the 300E. The Phenom 100 made its maiden flight on July 26, 2008, and has since achieved immense success, becoming one of the most popular light jets on the market. A new configuration of the Phenom will set you back approximately $3 million, and with over 400 units produced, it boasts a strong presence in the aviation world. Cockspur has recreated this popular aircraft within Microsoft Flight Simulator, offering a plethora of features that faithfully replicate its real-world counterpart. These features include Garmin G1000NXi avionics with a custom FADEC system, meticulously replicated switches, and authentic functionality to provide a true-to-life piloting experience. Dynamic systems bring the experience of managing and operating the Phenom's unique systems, closely mirroring the real-world aircraft. Flight dynamics have been finely tuned based on feedback from actual Phenom pilots, enhancing the overall immersion of flying the PH100. The visual modeling is equally impressive, with accurate 3D modeling, animations, and texturing that add to the overall authenticity. The PH100 package includes 11 liveries, with support for FS2020's dynamic registration system. Additionally, a paint kit is included, allowing users to create their custom liveries or recreate their favorite designs. To ensure a smooth download experience, Cockspur recommends using a download manager, especially during high server loads. Additionally, they suggest utilizing the recently released Simstaller by Parallel 42 (//42). The PH100 is available for purchase through the Cockspur store, priced at 26.99 â¬ / 29.48 $.
