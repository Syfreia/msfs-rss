    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, Just Flight announced that its much anticipated Concorde for Microsoft Flight Simulator will be released on the 30th March. The Concorde, produced by DC Designs to be both âan accessible and yet highly detailed rendition of this iconic aircraftâ, will provide the users with unique adventures as one of the worldâs first supersonic jetliners. The Concorde, according to the developers, will feature most of the special features found on its real life counterpart, including custom-coded fuel systems, fully operational engineerâs station, nose-droop mechanism, âadvanced autopilot system, and fly-by-wire controlsâ. A full list of features can be found on Just Flightâs website. Additionally, the aircraft has been given a custom-made flight model that accurately reflects its handling in âsubsonic, transonic, supersonic and super-cruiseâ phases of flight, which âwill require correct handling of the aircraft in order to achieve her famous high-altitude and high-Mach performanceâ. Currently, the Concorde is set to be priced at Â£27.99 / $39.99 / â¬34.95, excluding sales tax that may incur. To find out more about the DC Designs Concorde, visit their Facebook page.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After releasing a plethora of freeware backcountry airports for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Emerald Design is venturing into the world of payware for MSFS, with the Chunilna Cabin Strip, a remote airfield located 11km to the Northeast of Talkeetna, Alaska. Marking the first payware product created by the developer for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Chunilna Cabin Strip is set to feature a multitude of exciting features not typically seen in other addons. With the airfield being located in Alaska, the scenery will include four native Butterflies and Morel mushrooms only seen during the warm summer months. Furthermore, additional dynamic features were included, such as rain puddles, and a bonfire along with smoke from the cabin that only appears when the temperature drops.Â  Along with these various immersion-enhancing features, the developer has included hand-placed native vegetation, a sloped runway, custom ground textures, and much more. As well, a shortened feature list is viewable below.Â  The airport is set to release via the developer's website and store.flightsim.com for a price of USD $9.99. As well, Emerald Scenery Design is hoping to release the airport on flightsim.to and the MSFS marketplace but is still awaiting approval. Furthermore, the developer has stated that they are considering an Xbox release, but nothing is set in stone. Nevertheless, Threshold will make sure to keep you updated on any developments that arise with this product. In the meantime, make sure to check out the original announcement post on the MSFS Forums and the airport's product page for further information. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Umberto Colapicchioni dropped a second preview on his YouTube Channel regarding GSX for Microsoft Flight Simulator, showcasing the product's pushback procedures and animations, whilst the upcoming product is in its alpha build stage of development. This video starts off with Umberto summoning the GSX menu, and from eyeshot, viewers can see a variety of options from the menu. Items such as catering, refueling, boarding, and jetways are all shown in the UI along with other options the plugin is known for in its P3D and FSX counterparts.  After clicking on the pushback option, viewers see a handling operator menu, giving users the option to choose what air carrier operation pushes them back from the gate. The options included in the video are British Airways, Easyjet (both white and orange logos), and Virgin Atlantic. After choosing one of the options, viewers then can see a pushback tug pulling up to the aircraft, involving a ground crew member, fully animated.  After that, the aircraft pushes back, and once again, ground crew animations are fully animated, along with realistic flags and such being animated, and modeled.Â  FSDreamTeam did add a disclaimer that the product is in its Alpha version with features being subjected to change. Alongside this, no price or release date was announced by the development team.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, aircraft developer PMDG has published a new update on its much anticipated 737-700 project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, discussing the status of the aircraftâs testing, developmental progress, and upcoming plans. According to the developers, the testing of the aircraft continues smoothly, with some 70 issues reported by the testers and more than 120 solved by the development team. However, despite the 737 currently performing at a near satisfactory level, the developers expressed their frustration that MSFS currently lacks âtools that [they] would normally use to improve code stability and look for areas that require optimizationâ, preventing them from gaining vital insights on key areas needing improvements. In addition to updates on testing, the team also shined light on their current task of improving the details of some areas âto evaluate the impact different techniques may have on the performance of the simulatorâ. The developers are trying to gradually increase the level of details without sacrificing any performance, a process aided by their âincreased confidence in Asobo's rendering engineâ.Â The developer's progress is demonstrated by the completely rebuilt fire handles and light knobs pictured above. Finally, the developers revealed that a âfull bore promotional processâ will soon start, presenting the public with additional details on the aircraft and answering their questions. Currently, PMDG has not revealed the release date of the aircraft, claiming that its carefully designed workflow and testing procedure currently prevent it from determining a precise date. However, the developers teased that the 737 is âvery close to that pointâ where a firm release date can be set and the embargo can be lifted for beta testers. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. As their name suggests, UK2000 have previously exclusively developed sceneries located in the United Kingdom for various simulators. However, the developer is taking a different path with the announcement of John Wayne Airport (KSNA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This airport marks the first scenery by the developer located outside of the United Kingdom, as well as their first scenery located in America. Citing the reason for the switch as âpart business and part getting bored with UK airports,â the developer has stated that their venture into the American scene brings a âleap forward in improved HD PBR materials and Level of Detail for UK2000.â According to the developer, KSNA is also set to include a plethora of accurately placed custom-made models created in an efficient way to limit file size, and line markings with âblack-bordersâ typically seen in the United States have been included. As well, UK2000 has remodeled their general aviation library collection to include additional details with PBR materials. Furthermore, new models have been added, such as the C172, SR22, P-51, and B17 for the airport museum. Additionally, the airside terminal interior has been modelled, along with â21 unique animated Jetways with high PBR details.â Unfortunately, no further information was provided, and no release date or pricing information is known. However, it was stated that release is due soon so Threshold will make sure to keep you updated on any developments that arise with this airport. In the meantime, make sure to check out the official trailer for KSNA via UK2000 Sceneryâs YouTube Channel.</summary>

Conveniently, VCV was their first airport in X-Plane 11, and it appears that Xometry is continuing that theme.Â  Victorville is a local legend among AvGeeks and aviation nerds in the Pacific Southwest. Famous for its vast graveyard containing hundreds of stored airline relics, the played a significant role in keeping aircraft during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fleets such as the Aero California DC-9s, Delta MD-80, MD90, and FedEx DC-10s have found their permanent home in the lower desert.Â  Unfortunately, the Xometry team hasn't provided an MSFS-specific feature list, so we'll give you their X-Plane 11 features: We'll keep you updated when Xometry posts additional information regarding the upcoming scenery.
