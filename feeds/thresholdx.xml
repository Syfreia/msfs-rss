    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently released their rendition of Tenerife North-Ciudad de La Laguna Airport (GCXO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in Tenerife - the largest and most populous island in the canaries = with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  After five years of fund gathering, the airport was built in the late 30s to improve a spot where flights were already happening regularly ten years prior with C.L.A.S.S.A. â Commercial operations on the newly built airport started in 1941 with Iberiaâs fleet of DH89Aâs. Five years after its first proper commercial flight, the airport already had a couple of hangars, a passenger terminal, and a paved runway while also opening for domestic and international trafficâmultiple runway expansions followed during the subsequent decades. â The most significant runway expansion happened in 1964, when the runway was stretched to 3000 m to accommodate the DC-8, along with new navigation aids and an apron expansion. An ILS system was installed seven years later, in 1971.Â  â That decade marked the inauguration of Tenerife South, which only came to be because Tenerife North often suffered with thick fog, the main contributor to the Tenerife tragedy of 1977 involving two Boeing 747s, still the deadliest accident in aviation history. â A new terminal was inaugurated in 2002 with a four-story terminal building, 12 gates, and its international reopening after 24 years of domestic-only operations.Â  â Air Europa, Binter Canarias, CanaryFly, Iberia, IberiaExpress, Plus Ultra LÃ­neas AÃ©reas, Ryanair, and Vueling currently serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures and objects, animated jetways, animated custom vehicles, a modeled interior, realistic ground textures, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.38, requiring at least 1.99 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Leading Edge Simulations has recently released the v2 of their Douglas DC-3 for X-Plane 12, bringing two cockpit variants, custom-coded systems, and more. â Their newly released DC-3 features an accurately modeled Douglas DC-3 with heavy use of PBR materials, ensuring great visual acuity. There are two cockpit options, ranging from the classic layout from the 1930s-1940s and a modern style with modern instrumentation and avionics.Â   â The custom systems bring a deeply simulated electric system, two autopilot options, multiple navigation tools (VOR and ADF radios, GPS unit compatibility), a simulated hydraulic system, engines with fully simulated mixture control, a custom auto-feather mechanism, and realistic oil consumption figures depending on the engineâs health.  â It also features an airframe system where every livery is individually persistent, with individual options, maintenance logs, and states, which can be controlled through a user interface. â The developers also disclaim a list of things that will not be available right on release: the hydraulic system has correct indications, but X-Plane does not allow for deep interaction with it; the anti-ice systems are present yet not fully simulated; hardware support is said to be âbasicâ for the time being; the Sperry autopilot on the âClassicâ variant doesnât have heading mode, only the basic operations. â  Itâs available onÂ X-AviationÂ for $49.95 and is only compatible with X-Plane 12.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Asahikawa Airport (RJEC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Asahikawa in Hokkaido, with a yearly average of 1 million passengers.  â After half a decade of planning, the airport was inaugurated in 1966, with scheduled service beginning that same year with Japan Domestic Airlines, flying a NAMC YS-11 to Tokyo Haneda via Okadama. It was primarily seasonal until 1970 when there was finally a year-round flight to Tokyo.  Nearly twenty years later, the airport was briefly closed for expansion work, with its sole runway being extended from 1,200 meters to 1,640 in February 1982 and then to 2,000 meters in November 1982, allowing the operation of larger jet aircraft like the DC-9, the MD-80, and the Airbus A300. â In 2016, the administration made plans to build a new international terminal to the south of the old one, with 5,700 square meters of constructed area, targeting 500,000 international passengers yearly by 2030.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RFscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Verona Villafranca Airport (LIPX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Italian city of Verona with a yearly average of 3.5 million passengers. â Built as an air base in the early 1900s and heavily used during World War I, it opened to civil air traffic not long after the conflict with daily connections to Rome and multiple charter flight destinations in northern Europe. â A passenger terminal was built in the late 1970s by the Province of Verona, the Commune of Verona, and the Local Chamber of Commerce. A managing society was formed shortly after, sharing the ownership between provincial governments from Veneto, Lombardy, Trentino, and Alto Adige. â With healthy growth figures in the late 90s and early 2000s, the administration decided to expand the airport by constructing a new arrivals terminal, inaugurated in 2006. â Aer Lingus, Air Albania, AirBaltic (seasonally), Air Dolomiti, Albawings, British Airways, easyJet, Eurowings (seasonally), Finnair (seasonally), FlyOne, Jet2 (seasonally), Neos, Norwegian Air Shuttle (seasonally), Play (seasonally), Ryanair, Transavia (seasonally), TUI Airways, Volotea, and WizzAir serve the airport. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom airport buildings, custom ground vehicles, custom ground textures, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.06, requiring at least 374.60 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  Low-End Pc Studios has recently released their rendition of Coronel FAP Francisco Secada Vignetta International Airport (SPQT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Peruvian city of Iquitos with a yearly average of 1 million passengers. â It was built in the late 1920s as a gravel airstrip for military purposes, eventually evolving into a commercial airport over the following decades, along with several infrastructural upgrades and expansions.Â  â Its current name was adopted in 1973 after a local Peruvian Air Force pilot who had fought in the war with Colombia between 1932 and 1933. â The airport is of great importance to the cityâs economy because itâs only accessible by air or river, meaning every urgent logistical operation has to go through the airport, which also justifies the relatively high passenger figures in comparison with the cityâs population (1 million passengers yearly, and the city has less than half a million inhabitants). Said figures make it the fourth busiest airport in Peru. â LATAM Peru, SAETA Peru, Sky Airline Peru, and Star Peru serve the airport year-round.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a custom ground mesh, PBR textures, terminal interior modeling, custom runway elevation profile, animated objects, and a performance-friendly optimization. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.16, requiring at least 150.09 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Pilot Experience Sim has recently released their rendition of Brest-Bretagne Airport (LFRB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the French city of Brest with a yearly average of 1.1 million passengers.  It was built by the US Navy during World War I, originally featuring two airship hangars. An airstrip was only constructed after the war, becoming âBrest Guipavas Airfield,â but it did not survive World War 2: it had to be rebuilt.  Rebuilding efforts only took place in the early 1950s, with the airport being reopened for commercial use in 1952, connecting Brest to Ouessant and Paris by the wings of Air Inter.Â   With the popularization of air travel and the consequent increase in passenger volume, the airport underwent a massive expansion project in 1986, followed by a runway extension six years later, transforming the airport into a diversion ground for transatlantic flights. By 1989, the airport was averaging 500,000 passengers a year for the first time.  In December 2007, they inaugurated a brand new terminal, with 22,000 square meters of total area, able to accommodate up to 1.8 million passengers a year, with two wide-body jetways and fourteen stands for medium and small aircraft. Itâs shaped like a manta ray.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, performance-friendly optimization, PBR textures, a realistic terrain profile, custom jetways, and a custom GSX profile.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.00, requiring at least 1.93 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Dark Space has recently updated xEnviro to work with X-Plane 12.06r3, following up on a bigger update from late August that added a series of enhancements to both X-Plane 11 and 12.  Update 1.26 brought dithering technology to reduce sky banding, X-Plane 11 compatibility, in-cloud light scattering, and 1.27 warranted the compatibility with the latest version of X-Plane 12.  The developer team says they are actively working on reintroducing the features that were held back during the transition from X-Plane 11 to X-Plane 12. The following updates aim to reflect that. â xEnviro is available on itsÂ official website,Â Threshold Store,Â andÂ X-Plane.OrgÂ for $69.99.

    <title>Arif Studio Releases Chicago Executive Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Arif Studio has recently released their rendition of Chicago Executive Airport (KPWK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a public airport serving northwestern Chicago with a yearly average of 108,000 aircraft movements.  It opened in 1925 as Gauthierâs Flying Field in the village of Wheeling (Cook County, Illinois), purchased and developed by George J. Priester in 1953, who installed paved runways, lighting, hangars, and an ATC tower. It was then sold in 1986 by Georgeâs son, Charlie, to the city of Prospect Heights and Wheeling, when it was renamed Palwaukee Municipal Airport. â The current name was given in late 2006 after trustees from the village voted to approve a name change, better positioning the airport as a private aviation gateway to Chicago due to its proximity to the city. â â According to 2022 data, 80% of the yearly movements correspond to general aviation traffic, 20% to air taxi, and less than 1% are military. There are 296 aircraft based at the airport. â â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a recreation of all the hangars, numerous static objects, landside buildings, non-PBR texturing for file size optimization, custom night lighting, and more. â â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $8.52, requiring at least 31.18 MB of free hard disk space to install.
