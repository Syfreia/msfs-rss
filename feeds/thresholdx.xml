    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The renowned scenery developer, FlyTampa, has shipped out its rendition of Toronto Pearson International Airport (CYYZ), for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This release brings more of the developer's high-quality development and accurate renditions to the major intercontinental airport.  Toronto has a small history that dates back to 1937 when the Canadian Government opted to build 2 airports, one of which currently resides on the Toronto Islands which is present-day Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, and the other to be built in northwest Toronto, named the Malton Airport, and received its first passenger service in 1939. After WW2, the airport received international status in 1958 and was changed to Lester B. Pearson International Airport in 1984. FlyTampa has included a detailed feature list for this package. Starting off, an interior of the terminals has been provided alongside the latest layout of the airport as of 2022. PBR textures and Dynamic lighting are included as well. 3D terrain including both tunnels and bridges is accurately modeled to depict the current layout of the airport.  If you are interested in picking this scenery package for yourself, you can find it over on FlyTampaâs Website and it sells for $17.99. You can also find this airport for a variety of other simulators such as FSX and Prepar3D, over on their website as well.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, Asobo Studio released Sim Update VIII (v1.23.12.0) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The update brings a few new features and a large variety of improvements to simulator stability, weather, VR, developer SDK, and default aircrafts. Starting off with the new features, the developers announced that the Market Place will receive a brand new UI that brings âimproved discoverability and a better navigation experienceâ. Additionally, an optional propeller simulation system with âhundreds of moving surfacesâ is now available for the Cessna 152, Cessna 208 B Grand Caravan EX, and Beechcraft King Air 350i, improving the realism of propeller effects such as feathering and prop-drag. Finally, a new private match mode for Reno air Races can now be accessed via content manager and a new Spotlight Event has been added that features landing a Cessna Citation CJ4 at Reno Stead airport. In addition to the new features, Asobo Studio also introduced a long list of bug fixes and improvements that address almost every area of the simulator. The complete list can be viewed on MSFSâs website. Currently, Sim Update VIII is available to download for all users. As usual, the developers have reminded the community to temporarily move community packages to another folder if the new version brings âunexpected impact on the titleâs performance and behaviorâ. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Phillip from Laminar Research addressed wake turbulence in the upcoming X-Plane 12 Flight Simulator. Involving both player aircraft and AI aircraft and its correlation with the simulator physics and aerodynamics.  AI Traffic After a brief introduction about wake turbulence, Phillip addresses the wake turbulence that is left by AI aircraft. All AI aircraft will leave the correct wake turbulence that corresponds to its aircraft, and is calculated properly with the vortex that is created by the wing of the aircraft. Same will apply for user aircraft. Phillip then goes on to say:  Online Traffic, 3rd Party Plugins, and Live Traffic Further on, Phillip addresses wake turbulence left by online network aircraft, live traffic, and other 3rd party plugins. With the correct data through an ADS-B exchange, X-Plane will calculate the best effects to aircraft weight, wing area, and wingspan through the data the plugin provides. Current XP11 traffic plugins are compatible with the wake turbulence and will be a base function in XP12.  Thatâs it for todayâs update, but Threshold will be sure to keep you up to date with any further X-Plane 12 development updates.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Stefano from Leonardo Software House has updated the community regarding the status of its upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-80 for MSFS2020. The Long Beach-built airliner is officially in âadvanced beta testingâ, as the fixed Software Development Kit has allowed the team to progress on the project as anticipated. Thereâs no release date yet, as the foreseeable development is contingent on MSFSâs evolution.Â  LSHâs Release Plan Similar to their Prepar3D release map, Leonardo will most likely divide their Maddog packages by variant. The team will initially release the MD-82 with JT8D-217A engines, a 162Y configured cabin, and a Honeywell FMS to satisfy NAV, VNAV, and ACARS. Following the MD-82 will be an MD-83/88 expansion package, and then JT8D-217C/219 engines, the Canadian Marconi FMS and PMS, an EFB, as well as aging and servicing features.Â Â  Anticipated MSFS Features If youâre strapped for time, a few notable features of the release include: Below is the full feature list thatâll be included in the release version of the MD-80, the list is quite substantial, but not overwhelming.Â  Fly the Maddog X MSFS version 1.0 will include: - MD82 with -217A engines, PAX Cabin 162Y and Honeywell FMS for NAV/VNAV/ACARS; - Flight model and engines performances tested and matched against real aircraft performance tables; - All systems/avionics/tests etc, fully implemented as in the P3D version, including failures/INOPs feature, fully dimmable integral and flood lightning, working TCAS and EGPWS terrain mode; - New FMS Services page for controlling DOORS/STAIR, External power, fuel loading, etc.; - Fully integrated with MSFS ecosystem (jetway, catering, baggage loader, etc...); - Integration with PFPX/SimBrief via Load Manager and retrieval of OFP data via the ACARS system; - Livery manager, and aircraft settings configurable for different aircrafts; - Livery-based cockpit color (pink, blue or gray) and main panel variations (including placards and speed bugs); - Can be installed in the same machine with Fly the Maddog X for P3D; Configurable options from Load Manager:Â  - Panel state when starting simulation (Cold &amp; Dark, Ready at Gate, Ready for Takeoff...); - Weight &amp; Balance and route planner; - Load Manager units (Kg/mbar or Lbs/InHg); Aircraft options: - Cockpit units (Kg/mbar or Lbs/InHg); - PFD flight director style (cross bar or single cue), rising runway, ND wind arrow, groundspeed and aircraft map symbol, HDG UP or TRK UP option; - PFD wired to opposite NAV; - Armed altitude as FL and AutoArm altitude option; - Gear waring inhibit above 1500ft AGL; - Always play aural when autopilot disconnects; - Auto brake system; - Three VOR instrument versions: VOR/ADF/DME, VOR/ADF and VOR only; - Two altimeter versions: DUAL/SINGLE knob; - Optional TAS/SAT indicator; - Flat or Cone tail; Simulator options: - Enable failures; - Autopilot disconnect when flight controls moved; - Automatic update of aircraft weight and cg; - Automatic fuel loading; - Enable PM calls; - Sync CM1/CM2; - FSUIPC compatibility mode; - Maximum luminosity of all cockpit lights and instruments (flood, integral, LED, LCD and CRT); - Failures probability, separated for LIGHT, MEDIUM and DANGEROUS; - INOP systems according to MEL; Some Sidenotes Stefan informed the community that the Maddog will contain modifiable settings (including panel states) actively within the sim without requiring a flight restart. Another detail mentioned in the footnotes is the lack of weather radar functionality due to the SDKâs current state, but will be implemented, for free, as soon as the SDK will allow.Â  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As the war in Ukraine endures, Threshold is allocating all of the donation proceeds, including previous Threshold donations, towards the Ukrainian Crisis cause. 25% of all proceeds is set aside for Ukrainian X-Plane developers while the remaining is directly sent to UNICEFâs donation program for Ukrainian children.

    <title>Aerosoft Updates Mykonos Airport Scenery </title>
    <updated>2022-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently released an update for their Mykonos airport scenery. The update is quite lengthy and substantial with numerous changes made to keep the airport's virtual rendition up to date with the real airport. Let's take a closer look and highlight some of the more interesting additions made.Â  Before we get into the particulars. Looking at the images above we can really begin to appreciate how far scenery development has come, with the developers putting effort into seamlessly blending the airport into an already realistic default scenery. The releases of yesteryears in flight simulation would frequently have contrasting colours between the scenery satellite imagery and the default textures. The majority of changes have been prompted by the recent changes Mykonos airport has undergone. The $28 million upgrade has essentially given the airport a âfaceliftâ with a stunning new facade symbolizing the traditional Cycladic architecture. The project was set to open in 2021 and so it did, with no delay from Aerosoft who were relatively quick to follow suit and update their product. Hereâs their full change list for you to check out: Reading through the list, it seems the team at Aerosoft has almost completely recreated the airport, with new lights, new textures, new modeling and enhanced mesh, with existing users being able to expect an almost brand new product. It is pleasing to see this focus on what essentially can be referred to as virtual modernisation, especially as an update and not as a whole new product. While not expected from developers, scenarios like these are appreciated. Check out their official post on the update, and should you wish to purchase the product, it can be found on the Aerosoft store.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Recently, a new banner has quietly appeared on Just Flightâs website, announcing that the much anticipated Concorde for Microsoft Flight Simulator will be releasing sometime this month (March 2022). The aircraft, developed by DC Designs, is built ground up for the new simulator with customized handling models and accurate modeling/texturing, bringing users an enjoyable flying experience with the worldâs only supersonic airliner. Over the past few months, DC Designs has released weekly updates on the development progress of the Concorde. The latest one, posted on February 25th, teases that work is currently being done on PBR textures and showcases the external and internal modeling of the aircraft. It is clear from both the text and the pictures that Concord is near completion. 	Announced in mid 2021, DC Designâs Concorde âis designed to be both an accessible and yet highly detailed rendition of this iconic aircraftâ. To ensure a high degree of accuracy with its designs, the team has reconstructed the aircraft with hundreds of real life images of the Concord taken from museums and exhibits. Checkout Just Flightâs website for a complete list of the Concordeâs features. DCDesigns has priced the Concorde at Â£27.99 / $39.99 / â¬34.95. If there's any more news regarding the release, Threshold will keep you updated on this front. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has posted more previews of their upcoming BAe 146 for MSFS2020. The news comes in light of their subsequent aircraft developments, such as the newly announced 757, collaboration with DCDesigns, and In-House Fokker F28. The team mentions in their Facebook post that more news will be delivered in the imminent future and that "release time draws closer." The following screenshots showcase the aircraft partaking in a test flight from Southampton to Bournemouth.  For those who are unaware, the British Aerospace 146, also known as the BAe 146, is a short-haul regional airliner developed by British Aerospace. Containing four turbofan engines, as well as a T-tail, the "Jumbolino" garners its reputation from its quirky design features. Over 380 units were built from 1978-to 2001, primarily serving European operators such as CityJet and Swiss. The aircraft was delivered under the name "Avro RJ" after 1992, shipping with upgraded avionics and more powerful engines. In the current world, few Avro RJs remain, some serve middle eastern carriers, and some serve as "off the grid" transporters as the aircraft contains gravel landing abilities.  Just Flight did not share any additional information regarding the BAe 146's development, but keep an eye out shortly as the team admitted that there's a new development update around the corner.</summary>

    <title>Xometry Announces KeflavÃ­k International Airport For X-Plane 11</title>
    <updated>2022-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Xometry has announced their latest project which takes us to the far North, a land that is often missed by flight simmers and overlooked by those who cross the pond. KeflavÃ­kurflugvÃ¶llur or commonly referred to as KeflavÃ­k International Airport, is an airport many would have encountered but likely not visited. Typically overflown on routes between central europe and the west coast of the United States, this airport would likely feature as an alternative but hardly ever as a destination. Xometry could potentially have a reason to fly here.Â  The airport was initially established as a USAF base in 1942, later serving as a NATO air station, and as of 1987, becoming the gateway for passengers to the natural wonder that is Iceland. This airport is home to a few 757âs from IcelandAir, presenting us with the opportunity to operate the Flight Factor 757 outside of the USA. Handling almost 10 million passengers at its peak in 2018, it's anyone's guess as to why the flight simulation world has neglected to visit such an intriguing location. The project looks promising, with progress pictures that display an extreme level of attention to detail, which the team has claimed is their priority; mentioning âThe airport has been recreated in high accuracy with much attention being put into making sure that we bring you the most up-to-date rendition of BIKF currently available for X-Plane 11/12.â It is important to note that the team is aware, and ready to ensure this scenery is off the bat ready to be compatible with X-Plane 12, especially as we fast approach its release.Â  Taking a look at their provided feature list below, we see all the usual features we expect from high quality payware scenery developers, however what is particularly interesting and not so common in X-Plane, is the modeled interior, a feature which is often overlooked but a neat detail when implemented. This inadvertently adds to the immersion and is certainly not expected but highly appreciated when done correctly. Check out their full feature list below: For more information stay tuned and weâll bring you the latest when available. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. As X-Plane 12âs release date slowly encroaches upon our current simulators, it is almost time to say goodbye as we look to the future. One will know it's almost time to fork out and invest in the latest Flight Sim Software, when the time between announcements decreases, and with that our anticipation increases. In this article I want to give a brief breakdown on Laminarâs latest blog entry, detailing the latest progressions on the forthcoming simulator. Let's take a look. Confirming several speculations (and footage/software leaks as of late), X-Plane 12 currently resides within a closed private alpha group where our favorite third party developers have the opportunity to ensure their products are immediately compatible and without major bugs upon release. In the meantime, the team at X-Plane have provided in their announcement a table to give us a general overview on where the project currently stands and what still needs some work. As you will discover below, the announcement mainly addresses components mentioned under the âIn Progress'' tab in their table. We will break down these items as we progress through the article. The first item mentioned is rendering low visibility. The team at X-Plane have been hard at work to ensure that the fog visually reacts like fog, with a real focus on how atmospheric conditions will impact its appearance. Sunny days will now illuminate the fog and anything less than sunny will have fog appear slightly darker, with nights obviously having the darkest tone. In addition to this, the team has mentioned that their focus remains on ensuring the simulator represents an accurate environment in which instrument training can be conducted. They are achieving this by using a modeled âmonolithâ surrounded by runway lights as a calibration target, pictured below: Next, the announcement shifts to water, something we typically tend to avoid an interaction with, unless youâre using a seaplane. Despite this, water has long been an oversight within X-Plane, with default textures looking underwhelming and dull. For version 12, water receives a major makeover in both function and form. In line with most modern titles nowadays, the water will be 3D, finally allowing users to see physical waves; the team has even gone as far as to work with Seaplane pilots during the Alpha phase, to pay particular attention on getting seaplane behavior correct. Lighting is the cornerstone of X-Plane 12âs visual rejuvenation, now utilising a photometric system and running entirely in HDR. The team has updated their methods in which they design night lighting and light sources, such as urban lights and street lights. Precise attention has been given to sources that will impact your flying experience, such as approach, runway, and PAPI lights, which they have done in accordance to FAA specs. Previously, users relied on FlyWithLua scripts to bring life to a number of environment aspects within X-Pane, particularly lighting. We hope to see the new default lighting exceeding that of third party addons.Â Â Â  Anti-Aliasing is next on the agenda. X-Plane in the past has made partial use of a deferred renderer, what we have now learnt from the recent update is that in order to implement the new weather effects and lighting, deferred rendering will have to be and is the exclusive mode at which the X-Plane graphics engine runs. With the deferred rendering, X-Plane 12 will now support MSAA or Multisample Anti-aliasing which it was not able to when X-Plane only partially utilised deferred rendering. This comes with the potential for improved performance as opposed to the use of SSAA which severely impacted Frame Rate. To further improve framerate the team will be implementing AMDâs FidelityFX Resolution, which allows for faster rendering and presents users the opportunity to scale up to 4K and retain their framerate. In terms of third party support, below are some short sweet points, that were mentioned in the announcement: As mentioned in their full official update, which you can find here, the team has indicated that the next step from the current phase will be early access beta, which will be accessible to everyone willing to participate. This can be done through either a demo or full purchase. For more information stay tuned, or check out their full announcement. We will bring you the latest when made available.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Smooth seas donât make skillful sailors, Wellington International Airport is testament to this. Located just outside of the world's windiest city, this airport has notoriously had pilots constantly on their toes and challenging their skills. Windy Welly has since its inception, had pilots and seatbelts alike tested everyday, with a relatively short runway not making things any easier. That said, you canât beat Wellington on a good day! FlightBeam Studios have been hard at work to give us the opportunity to experience this airport first-hand, recently sharing a couple of preview images that evidently suggest that this project is indeed in its late phase of production. The textures are clear and complete with buildings looking true to reality. Unlike most sceneries, surroundings are particularly important here as your nose will almost never be straight down the centerline.Â  The precise attention to detail in the air bridge texturing in particular, demonstrates the teams capabilities, setting our expectations high as we hope this level of detail remains consistent throughout the scenery as a whole. We can confirm release is imminent as FlightBeam Studios have opened applications for Beta testers whom must meet the following prerequisites, as mentioned on their official application form:Â  For more information stay tuned. Do feel free to check out their original preview post. Should you be interested in beta testing and meet the above requirements, submit an application here.Â Â </summary>
