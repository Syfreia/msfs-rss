    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  Dominicdesignteam has recently released their rendition of El Paso International Airport (KELP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of El Paso (Texas), Las Cruces (New Mexico), and Ciudad JuarÃ©z (Mexico) with a yearly average of 3.6 million passengers.  It was built in 1929 by Standard Airlines as Standard Airport for transcontinental mail service, eventually becoming El Pasoâs main airport in 1936 after Standard became a division of American Airlines, which liked Standard Airport better than the other El Paso Airport.  During World War 2, the US Army utilized El Paso Airport to train three different bombardment groups.  The first expansion happened in 1971, tripling the terminal size with two new concourses built behind the old terminal, designed by Garland &amp; Hilles.  Its terminal features a pier-satellite layout and 15 gates, divided between A1 and A4 and B1-B11, with A1 and A4 being exclusively used by American Airlines and American Eagle, B1 for Delta Air Lines, B3, B5, B6, and B7 for Southwest Airlines, B10 for Allegiant, B8 and B9 for United Airlines and United Express, B4 for Alaska, and B11 for Frontier.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, dynamic lighting, real ground markings, custom hand-crafted pavement, custom jetway, custom animated objects, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.99, requiring at least 781.63 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport (LYBE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Serbian city of Belgrade with a yearly average of 5.6 million passengers. â â The airport was built from 1958 to 1962, when it was opened by President Josip Broz Tito, with a passenger terminal occupying 8,000 square meters, a 3,000-meter-long runway, and concrete aprons for sixteen airplanes. It used modern navigational equipment, which granted it the highest international classification according to the ICAO.  â The Yugoslav wars brought stagnation and sanctions, which reduced passenger movement to a minimum, and most of the facilities were decaying and in dire need of repairs. â International traffic only resumed in 2001, followed by a major reconstruction of terminal 2 and runway upgrades in 2005, bringing it up to CATIIIb standards. Its current name was given in 2006 after the famous Serbian-American inventor and scientist.  â Expansion and modernization work started in 2012, reconstructing the A and C gate departure and transit areas, adding an extra 2,750 square meters of built space. Â  Currently, both terminals occupy a total area of 33,000 square meters, with 66 check-in counters and 27 gates (16 with jetways). Terminal 1 is the oldest of the two, recently renovated in 2017. Terminal 2, the largest, was built in 1979 and renovated twice (2006 and 2013), with capacity to deal with 5 million passengers yearly. â  The airport is a hub for Air Serbia and WizzAir, connecting Serbia to the world. The visitorsâ list includes Aegean Airlines, Air Cairo, Air Montenegro, AnadoluJet, Arkia, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, easyJet, Eurowings, flydubai, Hainan Airlines, Jazeera Airways, KLM, Lot Polish Airways, Lufthansa, Luxair, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Nouvelair, Pegasus Airlines, Qatar Airways, Swiss, TAROM, and Turkish Airlines. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom VDGS, hand-made ground textures, dynamic airport lighting, highly detailed models, an official GSX profile, and performance-friendly optimization. â  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $20.64, requiring at least 9.16 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda has recently announced the development and imminent release of a Cessna 172M for X-Plane 12, part of theirÂ Dynamic Generation SeriesÂ of aircraft, with a strong focus on realism and customizability.  The 172M is a variant of Cessnaâs long-lasting 172 family of aircraft, introduced in 1955 and still under production to this day, with 44,000 units built in total, making it the most popular aircraft in the world. Said variant dates back to 1973, featuring a drooped wing leading edge as its main design difference compared to the previous variants, and the 1974 model had a baggage compartment expansion. Every model year brought a subtle change, with the lettering changing every four years on average (the M variant was manufactured from 1973 to 1976). For example, the L variant from 1971-1972 had changes on the main gear, a dorsal fin extension, and a propeller diameter reduction.Â   The last generation of 172Ms from 1976 marked the end of airspeed registration in miles per hour, switching to knots per the new standard. It was also the last generation to sport the Lycoming O-320-E2D with 150 horsepower, as the 172N had the âinfamousâ O-320-H2AD with 160 horsepower.Â   Thrandaâs rendition features extremely high-resolution textures (1700 pixels per meter) in 8K, a fully configurable 3D instrument panel, VR compatibility, interchangeable yoke styles, over 50 instruments to choose from, liberty to move instruments to any location on the panel, four panel presets, 3D lighting, a dynamic livery editor, full PBR control for livery creators, adjustable wear and tear, windshield ice and rain effects, individual functional circuit breakers, and more.  The complete feature list can be foundÂ hereÂ on their X-Plane.Org Store placeholder (as the product isnât out at the time of writing). The add-on will be available for $29.95 (25% off) and will require 1.4 GB of hard disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently announced the development and imminent release of Idahoâs Deadly 3 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a pack with three challenging airstrips and a bonus makeshift helicopter area with a STOL landing zone.Â  â The âDeadly 3â are three challenging airstrips scattered around Idaho with tricky approaches, uphill slopes, birds, wildlife, and drones!Â   â Dewey Moore, the first of the airstrips, is located on the north side of Big Creek, 19 miles west of the junction of Big Creek and the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, with a 700 ft long gravel runway at 4,494 feet above sea level. Itâs recommended for highly experienced mountain pilots only (in real life). â SimondsÂ is a very difficult airstrip located on Monumental Creek, close to where it joins up with Big Creek. Itâs often used for guided hunting trips and doesnât have any infrastructure, meaning pilots should bring their own tie-downs and camping equipment. It has a 900 ft long gravel runway, and pilots are instructed to watch for traffic from the nearby Monumental Ranch private airstrip. â VinesÂ AirstripÂ is located on the south side of Big Creek Canyon, two miles west of Cabin Creek Airstrip, close to where Big Creek joins into the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. Itâs a 1,100 ft gravel strip at 4,110 feet above sea level, and pilots are instructed to land on runway 27 and take off from runway 9. Real-life recommendations include instructions on short field operations, and pilots are generally advised to follow Big Creek to avoid trees on final approach and watch their airspeed very carefully as a 10 percent increase in approach speed means a 21% increase in landing distance.Â  â  The three strips are a short flight away fromÂ 85U Soldier BarÂ andÂ McCall Municipal AirportÂ (KMYL), both developed by Milo Taylor, the author of Idahoâs Deadly 3. His new creation features substantial terraforming work, custom animations, custom vegetation, and much more. The complete feature list for the package follows down below:  â There is no pricing or release date information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently released another update (v1.5.2.214) to their A320 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, tweaking the flight model with flare mode refinements, drag improvements, mitigating the nose down behavior on landing, and more. Itâs the second update post-V2 Block 1 (the first mitigated the high CPU usage issues on some systems), aiming to improve the flight model with tweaks on how the aircraft behaves on flare, allegedly making it less prone to floating, along with corrections on the drag behavior with flaps 3, and also sorting out the nose smashing down instantly upon touchdown.  They have also worked on improving the avionics, making the VNAV more polished, and correcting how the aircraft interprets certain restrictions. The high CPU usage across their bootstrapper and the app is also one of the things Fenix has managed to mitigate on this update. Other changes include sound improvements, minor art fixes, and volume level adjustments.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Jeju International Airport (RKPC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in South Korea with a yearly average of 31.3 million passengers.  Built as Jeju Airfield during the Japanese colonial period by the hands of enslaved Jeju locals, then taken over by the US Army after World War 2 and used by the Korean government as an extermination field during the uprising, where an estimated 700 Jeju citizens were shot to death (known in South Korea as the April 3 massacre, or Jeju uprising. The total death toll surpasses 30,000) and buried. Only 237 of the bodies were found during a full-scale excavation in 2007.  The airport was built in the late 1960s as part of a governmental effort to develop the islandâs tourism. It was inaugurated in 1968 with a 1,200-meter runway and a modestly sized terminal, initially aimed at domestic operations. Expansion work was only conducted in the 80s and 90s, lengthening the runway and upgrading the terminal facilities to accommodate larger aircraft and more passenger traffic. â The international status was granted in 2002 with the construction of an international terminal, kickstarting a massive growth in passenger traffic (from a 9 million/year average to almost 20 million within a decade). The numbers peaked in 2019 at 31 million passengers.  Itâs a hub for Jeju Air and a focus city for Air Busan, Asiana Airlines, Eastar Jet, Jin Air, Korean Air, and Tâway Air. Visitors include China Eastern, China Southern, HK Express, Scoot, Spring Airlines, and Tigerair Taiwan.Â  â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, highly-detailed models, performance-friendly optimization, and an official GSX profile.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $21.88, requiring at least 8.21 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The return of a classic, MicroProse announces, Falcon 5.0 after requiring the Falcon brand. Recently, MicroProse announced the successor to the Falcon series, Falcon 5.0. The Falcon series was one of the most sophisticated combat simulators of its time. Falcon 4.0 was released over 25 years ago and focused on a detailed, accurate simulation of the F-16 Falcon. Some rated it as close to 90% system accuracy. MicroProse was ahead of its time by coding the complexity of the "Vipers" flight systems, avionics, flight characteristics, and PvE AI combat. The simulator campaign is based on a South Korean/North Korean conflict with allied forces such as the United States providing military support and aiding South Korean defenses against invading North Korean aggression. You take on the role of a Viper Pilot under the United States Air Force. You are tasked with air-to-ground bombing runs, holding air space superiority, and more. â Starting with training, learn the nitty-gritty of jet combat and F16-specific combat maneuvers amidst dogfight scenarios. Learn armed tactics, weapon behaviors, and characteristics through 30 training missions. I wouldn't skip over them! Ahead of its time was a pilot rating system based on detailed kill reports and kill quality. The player's kills and actions directly affect the path of the game as well. In addition, Falcon 4.0 supported online multiplayer PVP dogfights, incredible for its time. Falcon 4.0 claimed some of the best reviews of any combat flight simulator for its time. The simulator reaches back to 1987, with Falcon 4.0 Allied Force as the most recent iteration. June 2005.  Hopefully, MicroProse will give us that ringed flight ops manual. â Â â PC-Pilot Magazine's Derek Davis interviews David Laettie of MicroProse covering the push and goal to get Micropose back into Flight Simulation. The interview has exclusive screenshots of a new aircraft addition to the Viper's simulation. Derek Davis also inquired about other flight simulation projects during the interview. Access to the article and exclusive cockpit shots of both aircraft can be viewed on PC-Pilot with a subscription.  â Falcon is still alive at the hands of Benchmark Sims Team akaBMS . BMS has worked to keep the title current with today's technology and modern software capabilities. MicroProse thanked the team for keeping the simulation alive through the years. It looks like an exciting acknowledgment and upcoming teamwork to bring the best out of Falcon 5! Benchmark Sims Team announced on Twitter that they have resolved the intellectual property subject with Falcon 4.0 and will continue development with minimal disruption. A highlighted version of the contractual agreement can be found on BMS's forum post.  â â Falcon 5.0 is expected to be on the markets before the holiday season.  â Stay tuned and expect more from Threshold for more information covering this evolving project! â  â  â  â â â</summary>
