    <title>iniBuilds Announces John F. Kennedy International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6424874e3696888342456a91_jfk1.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="3513815"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds hasÂ recently announcedÂ the development of their next mega-hub for Microsoft Flight Simulator: John F. Kennedy International Airport (KJFK), the primary airport serving New York City and the busiest of the lot, with over 60 million passengers per year.Â   Opened 74 years ago as New York International Airport, or Idlewild Airport, after the homonymous golf course that it displaced in the early 1940s, it originally featured a single 7,365 square meter terminal (expanded to 20,021 square meters in 1949) and six runways.Â   The current naming was only adopted after John F. Kennedyâs assassination in 1963 as a tribute. It was also back when the airport took the crown as New Yorkâs busiest, with more take-offs and landings than LaGuardia and Newark combined, and even managed to be the second busiest in the country with nearly 404,000 airline operations. With LaGuardiaâs eventual expansion, the figures evened out by the 70s, with similar flight counts.Â   As a curiosity, KJFK was the first airport in the United States ever to receive a commercial A380 flight in March 2007. The first regularly scheduled commercial flight to ever land on JFK happened a year later, by the wings of Emirates (Dubai - JFK route). The list of A380 operators with a regular schedule goes way beyond that, with Singapore Airlines, Air France, Korean Air, and Etihad Airways. It was also the first American airport to receive a commercial A350 flight in 2015.  The busiest international gateway to the United States is served and visited by over 90 airlines, covering all the inhabited continents around the globe. JetBlue tops the market share chart, with 28.8% or 15,624,961 passengers, followed by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, with 28.4% (15,390,437) and 14.5% (7,870,971), respectively. From foreign operators, Air France leads the way with 1.9% of the total market share or 1,025,339 passengers.  The scenery will feature highly detailed models of all airport buildings, objects, and surroundings, with hand-crafted ground poly, crisp textures, accurately modeled and positioned dynamic lighting, custom static aircraft, custom jetways (10+), true-to-life airport landside recreation, realistic taxi signage, up to date airport layout, fully animated JFK AirTrain between terminals, LOD optimization for optimal performance, use of the latest MSFS SDK features, and full iniManager compatibility to configure the scenery for the best performance possible. They also highlight an accurate rendition of the TWA Hotel with an intricately detailed interior and the Constellation aircraft in TWA colors.Â   There has not been any information on the release date, pricing, or install size. Stay tuned to Threshold for further details on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Snj Sim has recently released their rendition of Fukuoka Airport (RJFF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 4th busiest airport in Japan with a yearly average of 24 million passengers. It was built during late WW2 by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force as Mushiroda Airfield and later occupied by the USAF as Itazuke Air Base from 1945 to 1972. It was the largest USAF airbase on the island of Kyushu until its closure due to budget cuts and the gradual reduction of US Army presence in Japan. The airport saw civilian air service for the first time in 1951, with a Japan Airlines service from Fukuoka to Osaka and then Tokyo. JAL followed suit ten years later with a flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo. The first international flight only happened in 1965, to Busan in South Korea. Air Siam and Air France tried to offer international services in 1975 but it didnât last long. As one of the busiest airports in the country, Fukuoka gets visited by many domestic and international airlines, including Air Busan, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Cebu Pacific, China Airlines, EVA Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Japan Airlines, Jeju Air, Jetstar Japan, Korean Air, Peach Aviation, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, United Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines.  The scenery features a detailed rendition of Fukuoka Airport, with surrounding buildings, custom autogen, animated jetway models, custom airport groundpoly, realistic night dynamic lights, custom static vehicles, and AI traffic plugin compatibility (tested with FSLTL). They mention an eventual update once the work on the second runway and taxiways reaches completion. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.73, requiring at least 1 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Popular aircraft and scenery developers LatinVFR have recently released the latest addition to their ever-growing fleet of Airbus aircraft for MSFS. The A320 ceo has an impressive 90 liveries based on real-world operators and has engine options for both the CFM and IAE variants. The aircraft also comes with the option of the Airbus Sharklets rather than the standard Airbus wing tip devices.Â  The aircraft is the first of the LatinVFR fleet to feature their new EFB which provides an easy way to control the ground handling equipment which is modelled with the aircraft. The developer has noted that this EFB will eventually be implemented on their entire fleet.Â  Although the A320 appears to lack slightly in system depth when compared to the FlyByWire or Fenix options, there seems to be a real improvement on previous aircraft., LatinVFR appear to be marketing the A320 ceo to a market more suited to the casual sim pilot and to those using MSFS on games consoles.Â  The aircraft can be purchased through the MSFS marketplace for both XBOX and PC at the price of $24.99 â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their rendition of Tallinn Airport (EETN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Estoniaâs largest and busiest airport with a yearly average of 2,700,000 passengers.Â   The airportâs conception dates back to 1931 when the construction work began. Completion and the official opening happened five years later, despite being operational four years before, with LOT Polish Airlines flying a Fokker F.VIIb/3m.Â   During World War 2, the airport was first occupied by the Soviets (1940), then by Germany (1941-1944), and later under the Soviet helm again, with Aeroflot being the sole operator for 44 years. During that period, the airport got a new terminal, designed under Stalinist architecture, and finished in 1954. As the years went by and the traffic figures increased significantly, there was a need for a newer terminal, built between 1976 and 1980, just in time for the 1980 Summer Olympics sailing event held in Tallinn. The new terminal was designed by Mihhail Piskov, taking inspiration from traditional Estonian housebarn architecture, and Maile GrÃ¼nberg designed the interior. Â   Recent work included the construction of a cargo terminal in 1997 and a passenger terminal modernization in 1999, increasing the passenger capacity and improving the infrastructure. It was expanded again in 2008 to 35,000 square meters, the current standard. The expansion included 18 new gates, ten new check-in desks, a new restaurant and cafes, and separate lounges for Schengen and non-Schengen flights.Â   There are plans to expand the airport by 2035, bringing the total capacity up to 8 million passengers per year, 85,000 square meters of expanded area, and 26 gates.Â   The scenery features a high-quality rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom clutter, custom ground textures, custom jetways, interiors on all terminal buildings, static aircraft, GSX Pro compatibility, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $22.86, requiring at least 1.95 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TropicalSim has recently released their rendition of Robert L. Bradshaw Airport (TKPK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Basseterre on the island of Saint Kitts in the West Indies.  The airport was built in the 1940s as an airfield to serve the needs of the Royal Air Force during World War II. After the war, it was turned over to the local government and became a civilian airport. Over the years, the airport underwent several upgrades and expansions, including the construction of a new terminal building in the 1990s and a major renovation between 2004-2006, at the cost of 17 million USD.  With a yearly average of 400,000 passengers, St. Kitts Airport is served by ten airlines: Air Canada Rouge, Air Sunshine, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, InterCaribbean Airways, Silver Airways, Sky High, Trans Anguilla Airways, and United Airlines. Interestingly, the American Airlines service between St. Kitts and Miami/New York has been going on since 1979.Â   The scenery features a high-detail rendition of the airport, with full night illumination, native MSFS dynamic lighting, seamless integration with the default scenery, full use of the SDK, up-to-date ground layout, custom ground markings, terminal interior, and 3D passengers.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.78, requiring at least 1.36 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iBlueYonder has recently released their rendition of Dallas Love Field (KDAL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 31st busiest airport in the United States with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  It opened 105 years ago as a training camp for WW1 pilots and then converted into a storage facility for surplus aircraft right after the war, where it barely saw any action for nearly ten years. It was then purchased by the city of Dallas in 1928 and opened for civilian use, with the first set of paved runways to come four years later.Â   The first proper terminal was built in 1940, serving 21 weekday airline departures from American, Braniff, and Delta.Â   World War 2 forced the airport to return to its training school roots, only ceasing after it was all over when it once again returned to being a civil airport.Â   With the increased passenger figures during the late 1950s came the need for a new terminal (T3), designed by Donald S. Nelson, with three concourses, 26 gates, and the worldâs first moving walkways.Â   Nowadays, the airport has a single terminal with 20 gates, with Alaska and Delta Air Lines having one each, and the remaining 18 are under Southwestâs helm. Not coincidentally, Southwest Airlines has 95.3% of the passenger market share, followed by Delta with 2.2% and Alaska with 1.7%. Houston (387,000), Denver (367,000), and Atlanta (358,000) compose the top list of busiest destinations from Love Field.  The scenery features an accurate and up-to-date rendition of Dallas Love Field, with custom ground textures, a modeled terminal interior, hand-crafted and hand-placed signage, custom night lighting, a custom Dallas cityscape with notable downtown landmarks, custom runway approach lighting, and minor details such as sculptures, fountains, etc.Â   Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $15.96, requiring at least 5.52 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RFscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Brindisi Papola Casale Airport (LIBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 20th busiest airport in Italy with a yearly average of 3 million passengers.  First established as a military airbase in the 1920s, it saw commercial traffic action for the first time in 1934 with Ala Littoria. This government-owned airline resulted from merging four Italian airlines (SAM, SANA, SISA, and AEI), offering a single destination: Rome. The airline collapsed after the war and became Alitalia (also defunct), then called Aerolinee Italiane Internazionali. Under the new name, they also added a new destination to the roster: Catania.  The airport retained its military status until 2008, despite maintaining its military facilities to this day, although referred to by a different name: Military Airport Orazio Pierozzi. The civil name (Papola Casale) was given after Antonio Papola, a deceased Italian aviator with tight bonds to the city.  The airport is served by many airlines during the summer season, with Ryanair, AlbaStar, easyJet, Eurowings, ITA Airways, Swiss, and WizzAir being the few to offer routes all year long. The seasonal visitorsâ list includes Aer Lingus (starting in May 2023), Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Volotea, and Vueling.Â   The scenery features custom airport buildings, landside buildings, custom ground service equipment, custom night lighting, glass effect on windows (buildings, terminal, and vehicles), custom ground textures, and an up-to-date layout. â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.40, requiring at least 721.84 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Colombian Virtual Design has recently released their rendition of Santa Ana Airport (SKGO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Cartago in Colombia with a yearly average of 10,000 passengers.  The airport was built in the 1940s by the Colombian Air Force and later opened to civilian air traffic. It was initially used for PPL training, known as a cradle for great pilots, but it eventually embraced the commercial airline world as the main regional airport for the Valle del Cauca department.Â   It underwent expansion work in 2011, increasing the passenger capacity at the terminal to 180 people in the boarding area and adding metal detectors.  Cartago was adopted by many airlines around the region for ideal weather conditions throughout the year, along with a runway long enough for most aircraft, which any other airport in the area doesnât offer.Â   Itâs served by EasyFly and Satena, with two daily flights to Bogota.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with realistic ground markings, updated ground layout, performance-friendly optimization, and custom ground clutter.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.08, requiring at least 37.44 MB of free hard disk space. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recentlyÂ postedÂ on âThe Arlanda Journal,â their page for reporting the development progress on their rendition of Stockholm-Arlanda for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with information on an upcoming update for their Gothenburg Landvetter Airport (ESGG) scenery, also for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â   Gothenburg Landvetter is the second largest airport in Sweden, averaging 7 million passengers per year. It was inaugurated in 1977 by King Carl XVI Gustaf, replacing Torslanda Airport, deemed too small to handle the traffic demand.Â   Itâs a focus city for Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, SunClass Airlines, and TUI fly Nordic, sporting a sizeable inter-European route network. The visitorsâ list includes major European carriers, like Air France, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Finnair, KLM, Lufthansa, and Swiss.Â   Orbx claims they are hoping for a quick release, with testing underway. They highlight the addition of animated airside traffic, with variable intensity according to the time of day and with smoothness in mind. Other than that, they also mention the implementation of snow banks that only appear under certain conditions. The rest of the feature list includes animated jetways, functional and correct VDGS for all parking spots that got them, ground texture enhancements, interior enhancements, custom approach light objects, snow trucks when itâs snowing, updated GSE and clutter, static business jets (optional), new Scandic hotel, the new terminal, and a GSX profile.Â   While the update is not out yet, Orbxâs Gothenburg can be found onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $12.18 (on sale for 13 days), requiring at least 5.46 GB of free hard disk space to install. The update is going to be entirely free for previous owners. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Tivat Airport (LYTV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in Montenegro with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers (pre-pandemic).Â   The airport was originally just a grass airfield in 1957, with a small apron and a terminal building. Most traffic was strictly domestic for the first decade, with DC-3s and II-14s. The first modernization began between 1968 and 1971, with an asphalt runway, a bigger apron, extended taxiways, and a substantial terminal expansion. An earthquake eight years later forced them to refurbish it again, with increased dimensions to fit widebody aircraft. After an ownership change in 2003, the airport had another major modernization, with an improved terminal.Â   In the early 2010s, the administration realized the current terminal would not hold up with the gradual increase in the yearly average, so planning and building a second terminal, inaugurated in 2018 by their Prime Minister.Â   Most of the traffic is seasonal, peaking in the summer. Many airlines from all over Europe are visiting, including Austrian Airlines, easyJet, Edelweiss, Eurowings, LOT, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Transavia, and Turkish. Air Montenegro and Air Serbia are the only ones offering all-year-long coverage with a route to Belgrade. Â   Developed by one of their indies (Rasha Tucakov), the scenery features a high-detail rendition of Tivat Airport, with detailed terminal interiors, parallax windows, custom apron and runway textures, custom library objects, and many custom points of interest on approach.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.44, requiring at least 1.83 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MM Simulations has recently teased the progress on their rendition of LiÃ¨ge Airport (EBLG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the 5th biggest cargo airport in Europe and 22nd in the World.Â   Originally a military airfield, it was used by the Germans during World War II as a base for their Luftwaffe aircraft. After the war, the Belgian Air Force used the airport until the 1960s, when it was converted into a commercial airport. In the 1980s, LiÃ¨ge Airport became known for its cargo operations and became a major European freight transport hub. Today, the airport is one of the largest cargo airports in the World, handling over 900,000 tons of goods each year and serving as a vital link in the global supply chain.  TUI fly Belgium is the only airline offering scheduled flights to and from LiÃ¨ge, with routes to Alicante, Gran Canaria, MÃ¡laga, and Tenerife-South. The traffic figures sit at less than 400,000 passengers yearly.  The developers have been showcasing the scenery on theirÂ Facebook page, with many screenshots of the terminal interior, cargo area, and some of the cargo apron. A selection of these screenshots will be posted alongside this article.  Thereâs still no pricing and release date information, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <title>DarkBlueScenery Releases Lanzhou-Zhongchuan International Airport for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12</title>
    <updated>2023-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. DarkBlueScenery has recently released their rendition of Lanzhou-Zhongchuan International Airport (ZLLL) for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12, serving Lanzhou in China with a yearly average of 7 million passengers.Â   Inaugurated in 1970, Lanzhou Airport is the Chinese airport furthest from the center of the city it serves, at an incredible 71 kilometers away from downtown. Such distance is explained by the areaâs geography, which doesnât offer many options.Â   The first expansion project started in 1997, increasing the airportâs passenger handling capabilities to nearly 5 million a year. It held up well until the early 2010s when the operator finally saw the need to expand it again with a brand-new terminal. Terminal 2âs construction began that same year, opening five years later.  With traffic projections nearing the 10 million passenger ballpark shortly, they have decided to expand again with a brand new terminal currently under construction. The work started in 2019, costing 31.69 billion Yuan and a total area three times bigger than both current terminals combined. For such an ambitious goal, they had to demolish an entire town and adjacent villages, totaling up to 10.7 square kilometers of area.  The airport is served by many domestic airlines, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Spring Airlines, and Tianjin Airlines.Â   The scenery depicts the current stage of the airport, with Terminal 3 still under construction, featuring custom ground textures, custom models for Terminals 1 and 2, a cargo terminal, custom jetways, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.18, requiring at least 384.43 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
