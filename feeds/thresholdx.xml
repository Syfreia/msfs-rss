First announced in March 2021, VATSIMâs volunteer development team has been manufacturing new backend software that increases the refresh rate to allow for pilots to experience up-to-date positions of fellow aircraft.Â 

Pilots are now able to experience the program for themselves, as Velocity has been implemented into VATSIM and is in use as of today, January 31st. The planned downtime has already occurred, so pilots nor controllers need to worry about any operational disruptions.Â 

No impact has been made to any existing ATC clients, and they will work as they have with no additional difficulty. Pilot clients require an update to their newest versions to implement this new technology.Â While insignificant, the Velocity update also brings some other changes to the VATSIM platform, pertaining to better error messaging, and new member registrations being automatically updated into the system.Â 

Specific Client Updates:

To close, the VATSIM team thanks all users for their patience with the Velocity rollout, and to the volunteers who made the project possible.</summary>

With Asobo and the teams at Microsoft announcing World Update 6 and the new Game of the Year Edition last October, they have shipped World Update 7 to users, three months later. This time jumping to Australia for another one of their large scale nationwide rejuvenation; a comprehensive visual overhaul with new photogrammetry cities, and handcrafted airports.

The last World Update for MSFS takes place across the globe, which celebrates the launch of Windows 11. This update brings the game version to 1.22.2.0 and primarily is a countrywide cosmetic overhaul like previous World Updates, the update brings various new bush trips, handcrafted airports, and much more, showcasing the natural beauty of Australia in MSFS graphics and glory.

The changelog for this update is very simple and down to the point. In partnership with the artists at Orbx, the team has revamped the terrain profile of Australia, complimented by updated aerial imagery, and water masking for the country as well. The development teams have also updated over 100 smaller airports across the nation, alongside adding 54 new airports that were not previously present in the Simulator.

Users are now able to add various POIâs such as the Brisbane Skytower or photogrammetric cities such as Melbourne via the in-game Marketplace. Bush trips and landing challenges across both Australia and Tasmania have been added via the Marketplace as well for users to enjoy. Users can also take a discovery flight to see some of the most famous landmarks in Australia. If you are interested in the changelog of this World Update, you can view it on the FS Website.

The update has been made available to all users upon launch of the game, though Asobo has made note to move the Community folder whilst the game is updating to avoid stability issues. Thatâs the end of this update, Threshold will be sure to keep you in the loop!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS

JustSim has released an immaculate rendition of Milas-Bodrum airport for MSFS. For all our readers who enjoy taking their jets to various holiday destinations across Europe, this release will definitely interest you.





With the approach to both Runway 10 left and right, taking a scenic course over the warm Mediterranean sea, and the airport as a whole located just a stone's throw away from the shoreline. Milas-Bodrum is a true coastal airport, taking on a vast amount of holiday goers each year. The airport is located 36km NorthEast of Bodrum, with the city of Milas a mere 16km to the South. It's no surprise the airport takes on around 2.5 million passengers each year.



The airport boasts a relatively new international terminal, which opened in 2012. The old terminal, built in 2000, is now being utilized for domestic services. As expected, JustSim appears to have not cut any corners on this scenery, with all components of the airport evidently modeled with precision and care. That said, weâll let you be the judge with the following images:





The product is fairly priced, at 16.50 â¬ on the simMarket store. Do feel free to take a look at their Facebook page here. Should you be interested in purchasing this product, it can be found here.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane

Aircraft developer TorqueSim has published its roadmap, including status updates on current and upcoming projects. The team has emphasized their focus on the X-Plane 12 platform, as their existing products will be seeing updates for the sim once it releases. Though their AFM M20 Collection will be discontinued itâs being replaced by the upcoming Moony M20R.Â 

Updates

TorqueSim plans on releasing the 1.3.0 G1000 update soon, upgrading internal processes while adding new features. This update will also prepare the software for X-Plane 12.

Once X-Plane 12 releases, users can expect free compatibility updates for each aircraft in their product line to ensure ease of use within the sim.Â 

BN-2 Islander

Existing users will receive a free update to X-Plane 12. Itâs unknown whether the update will be split into two parts like the SR series aircraft.

Pocket Rocket

Similar to the BN-2 Islander, the Pocket Rocket will also receive a free update to X-Plane 12, with additional features exclusive to the new sim. It will also receive significant internal improvements such as a new variant equipped with the Allison 250 B17 engine.

CitationJet 525

Complementing their development update, the team has shared new previews of its CitationJet 525 project. TorqueSim is still âsquarely in the middle of developmentâ, but is expediting progress on the jet to release it as soon as possible. They claim that itâll be the most expansive aircraft in its class for any flight sim. Citation 525 will include custom systems, failures, avionics, and more. However, the team intends on the aircraft being an X-Plane 12 exclusive release.

TorqueSim Mooney M20R

TorqueSims Mooney M20R has been developed into a completely new aircraft, everything from textures and modeling to systems have been reimagined. Some of these systems will be comparable to those in the SR series.Â 

The team is simulating both the M20R Ovation II and Ovation III. Users can expect to see compatibility with RealSimGears G5, RealSimGears G500, RealityXP GNSS, and RealityXP GTNS, as well as the default X-Plane GNSS. The Ovations will follow the C525 suit, as they will be X-Plane 12 exclusive also.Â 

âAFM M20 Collection

A (positive) consequence of the new Mooney M20R development is the retirement of the preceding AFM M20 Collection. The aircraft will remain available for X-Plane 11, and all existing customers will be able to take advantage of an upgrade discount to the superseding TorqueSim M20R.Â 

As TorqueSim continues to make rapid progress on its new projects, stay tuned with Threshold as we will keep you updated with all future news regarding X-Plane 12 updates, as well as the C525.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS

Onfinal Studios has recently released Mehamn Airport (ENMH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This scenery, bringing to life the small regional airport located at the northern tip of Norway, is a refreshing addition for pilots seeking brand new adventures in the wilderness of Scandinavia.

According to the sceneryâs store page, Mehamn Airport will feature everything from detailed 3D models, custom objects, night lighting, and PBR textures. The developers also stated that the airport will accurately reflect the latest layout of its real-life counterpart with correctly placed taxiways and runways. For the complete feature list, check out the productâs store page

Mehamn Airport, located in northern Norway, serves the village of Mehamn. The main airline for the region is WiderÃ¸e, which operates Dash-8s. For pilots seeking to test their landing skills, the airport âoffers a challenging offset localizer approach with a stunning view [and a short 880-meter runway]â.

Currently, Mehamn Airport (ENMH) can be purchased on simMarket for $9.05 USD. To successfully install the scenery, the developers recommend users have at least 63MB of free disk space. It is also interesting to note that Mehamn isnât Onfinal Studiosâ first Scandinavian scenery; previous sceneries released by Onfinal Studios include Bronnoysund Airport and Batsfjord, both of which can also be purchased on simMarket.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane

After much speculation over Thranda Designâs newest aircraft for X-Plane, the developer has taken to the X-Plane.org Forums to announce theÂ C208 Caravan 675 and C208B Grand Caravan will be arriving for X-Plane. Although no confirmation was given over whether the aircraft will be made for X-Plane 11 or 12, judging by the in-sim screenshots, it appears that the aircraft will be available in X-Plane 11.

Containing both the C208 Caravan 675 and C208B Grand Caravan, the developer has assured users that the aircraft will contain all features from their Dynamic Generation Series product line. This means that the aircraft will boast âdynamic liveries, dynamic panels, dynamic dirt controls, DynaFeel flight dynamics enhancement, dynamically configurable for cargo, passenger, and executive version,â along with much more.Â 

Although relatively little information was provided regarding a potential release date or pricing information, it was confirmed that the aircraft is being readied to enter beta, and is in the âfinal stages of production.â As well, no information on any potential X-Plane 12 upgrade was mentioned. For any further developments that arise for Thranda's newest aircraft for X-Plane, Threshold will make sure to keep you updated.

Furthermore, for additional information and screenshots, make sure to check out the original announcement via the X-Plane.org Forums.</summary>

    <title>UnAir Releases Leicestershire AeroClub for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS

Shortly after announcing the development of Leicestershire AeroClub, UnAir progressed to release in good time. The airport, although small, is a great midpoint to get fueled, fed and watered, as you head on cross country to the sunnier southern countryside.

The airport serves mainly general aviation aircraft and is home to a couple of rotary wing operators, such as Helicentre Aviation. Looking at the images below, UnAir has visually done justice to this small airfield, bringing this virtual rendition to life and crafting that authentic airfield feel, so much so, one could vividly catch the scent of avgas.Â 

Comparing the already impressive images provided upon the announcement of this scenery, with the newer visuals, shown above, clearly demonstrates the extra effort gone into this project between phases.The product includes a number of standard features we expect from all high quality payware sceneries, listed below is their full provided feature list:

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Detailed depiction of Leicestershire Aero Club in the UK.

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Handcrafted models.

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ 4K and PBR textures in most of the models.

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ 4K and PBR in ground textures.

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Enhanced orthophoto imagery

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Interior modeling of the main building, Helicentre hangar and one with stands.

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Dynamic night lightning.

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Hand placed vegetation.

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Animated objects in the kart circuit.

Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Optimized performance that works in most computers.

It is evident that a great deal of care and attention to detail was present when rendering this scenery. With some issues raised by the community upon announcement, seemingly taken into consideration before release, UnAir has displayed their ability to take criticism and use in a constructive manner which appears to reflect in the final product.Â 

Priced at a fair 10.00â¬, this scenery can be found on the SimMarket store. Additionally checkout UnAirâs Twitter page for more information.</summary>

    <title>PMDG 737 for MSFS Approaches Beta</title>
    <updated>2022-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ng3feb" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane

Robert Randazzo at PMDG has shared further details regarding the development of their 737NG for MSFS. As the team makes more progress on the aircraft, the aircrafts is approaching beta testing stage.Â 

Today's update, posted on the PMDGÂ Forums, shared a general status update regarding development as well as delving into the details on upcoming testing processes in the upcoming beta testing, and smaller requirements such as implementing key binds correctly.

The 737 now contains the ability to be flown on âcompleteâ flights which allows the developers to test for bugs and other broken aspects of the plane. Randazzo claims the system's logic has been developed and is currently in testing. Overall, the software is stable and usable, which has led PMDG to focus on MSFS interfacing, like ensuring that keyboard shortcuts and MSFS commands are compatible with the plane.Â 

Since the 737 is in a flyable and usable state, the developers are now focusing on refining their product rather than focusing on the implementation of features. An example of this shift of focus is the refinement of the auto flight system control laws. Complementing this focus shift is PMDGâs embedding of new capabilities available to MSFS.

As the 737 finds itself becoming more complete, PMDG has set an internal beta testing date. Randazzo ensures that their âconfidence in hitting that beta date is very highâ, and that they are also projecting a release date. Unfortunately, these dates havenât been publicly announced yet, but the time is approaching to reveal more information regarding the 737âs relatively imminent release.

As development starts to come to a focus on ironing out of issues, rather than adding new features, we'll likely see an increase of images and teasers being shared by PMDG and other aircraft testers.

Take a look at our previous article on the development of the NG3, where the above image of the testing tail cone was originally shared.

As the MSFS community eagerly awaits the upcoming Fenix Simulations A320, itâs safe to say the team here at Threshold is equally as excited, that said, it's with shared anticipation and excitement, we present some newly released progress pictures from the team at Fenix Simulations, take a look:





As many will agree, one of the perks of being involved in the flight simulation world is being able to witness, first hand, the developments and advancements in visual integrity and animation capabilities. Microsoft flight simulator as a whole, has been a perfect example of this, with the jump between FSX and MSFS2020 truly showing how far we have come in replicating reality. The Fenix A320 appears to be no exception to this.

These images display a level of texture work and detail that was once inconceivable. The texturing shown above, perfectly resembles that of the typical A320 cockpit surface, hard worked, worn and cold to the touch. Notice the swelling edges on the panels, the oily touch points, the dents and scratches, all randomly occurring. It is evident the team have been meticulous and extremely detail driven whilst composing this aircraft.Â 

As mentioned in our previous article, the team at Fenix simulations have upped their resources and focus on the aircraft itself, in order to get us up and flying as soon as possible. With the aircraft having gone into beta testing not long ago, we all simply hope the release will be soon.

Until then, stay tuned as weâll be sure to keep you updated as and when information is made available.</summary>

Nimbus Simulation Studios has recently teased that their much anticipated Washington Dulles International Airport scenery (KIAD) for X-Plane 11 is nearing release. The airport, announced more than two years ago, will become the first payware scenery for Dulles and will become the gateway for countless pilots to the American capital.

From the pictures that accompanied the post, we can see that the modelling and texturing work on the various buildings, taxiways, and runways across the airport is already complete. Other details, such as cargo pallets, stationary aircraft, ground vehicles, and signs that are scattered across the field also look to be finished. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that the scenery is very close to being ready for release. However, apart from the pictures, the developer hasn't provided any additional information regarding the upcoming airport, such as a feature list.

Washington Dulles Airport is located some 45km outside of the nationâs capital and is one of the main international airports that serve the region. A hub for United Airlines, KIAD supports more than 40 different airlines and flights to over 125 destinations. In 2019, it saw more than 24 million passengers.

Currently, Nimbus Simulation Studios has yet to announce a firm release date or pricing for the scenery. Threshold will keep you updated on this front.

Nimbus not only develop their renowned sceneries but also work on aircraft such as their BN-2 Islander and UH-1 helicopter.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane

Boundless Simulations has released yet another historical airfield for X-Plane 11. They have traveled over to Lasham Airfield to provide users with a custom visual rendition of the WW2-era airfield.

The airfield was built in 1942 as a station for the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. It provided and launched support through many major battles in the European Theater of the war. When the war ended, the RAF ceased operations at Lasham Airfield in 1948, just 3 years after the end of the war. The General Aircraft company continued to operate out of the airfield. Today, Lasham Airfield is owned and maintained by the Lasham Glider Society.

The development team has included a short yet down-to-the-point feature list upon release. Starting off, PBR textures have been used for airport buildings, and custom HD ground texturing. HD textured vegetation and static aircraft have been included. Alongside this, accurate night lighting and ground markings have been added as well to add on. Boundless has also included full support with the Traffic Global plugin. Finishing off, the team has made this scenery FPS friendly, for users with lower-end computers. You can find the full feature list below:

If you are interested in picking up this scenery package from Boundless, you can find it over on their iniBuilds Store and selling for Â£8.99 GBP*. If you are interested in any other sceneries by Boundless, you can check out their catalog over on their website.</summary>

As one will notice the scenery already looks absolutely incredible, living up to the quality and attention to detail we have come to expect from the Inibuilds brand at large.Â 

iniScene London Heathrow for Microsoft Flight Simulator | Teaser

Taking a closer look, it appears iniScenes wishes to use the video to highlight some of the landmark features of the airport, such as the Turkish Airlines Globe, as well as the majestic 45 ton Emirates A380 model display. What was particularly interesting, was the trademark purple lighting at Virgin Atlantic's check-in area in Terminal 3, a familiar site for many. It's these types of minor details that could have gone unnoticed, but make all the difference and create that immersion we all strive to gain. With IniScenes promising this to be their âmost detailed and feature-rich scenery to date.â we can be sure there is much more to come.

The video features so much to see in so little time, therefore it's with bated breath we await further updates. No feature list has been given at this stage. What we know for sure is, this product will undoubtedly come with much anticipation within the MSFS community, as Heathrow holds a soft spot in the hearts of many aviators, with many historical aviation events taking place here over the years. In addition to this, as Heathrow was for many years the world's busiest airport, it's statistically likely many of our readers would have spent some time here, making it a highly relatable product.Â 

For those of us who have always marveled at the heavy metal that wallows in the sky above London and those lucky enough to visit Heathrow itself, it's without a doubt that iniScenes will do this airport justice; given their track record, and bring back those nostalgic moments for all who possess them. For more updates stay tuned and weâll be sure to bring you the latest.

Orbx has recently published its 2022 roadmap. On their forums, Orbx chief Anna Cicognani began with a belated âHappy New Yearâ then explained that in the short period between the real New Years to today, the team took some time to introspectively analyse their past achievements and how it can inform and drive their future direction. The team recently strengthened their relationship with Microsoft from the collaboration on the Australian World Update and the Fokker, propelling them to a strong start into 2022, Anna noted that the two projects is a labour of love that span many months:

Â 

Cigcognani moves on to wrapping up 2021 and what the team achieved, releasing a whopping total of 58 products that includes anything from 18 in-house airports, including their home airport Essendon across three flight simulators, 10 City renditions, 3 regions, and the teamâs first aircraft (Edgley Optica), the rest are Indie releases from 3rd party developers.

For Orbx, 2021 was a year with intense expansion into the new MSFS simulator, with 47 products being released for the simulator alone, followed by 8 released for P3D and 5 for X-Plane respectively.

Looking into the future, Cigcognani has laid out a smorgasbord of releases, beginning with the (just) released Prague airport for MSFS, with eventual versions for Prepar3D and X_Plane forthcoming. Next on the release board is a detailed rendition of Panama Canal which is in the finishing stages âwith lots of exciting featuresâ. See here for the original list:

Orbxâs independent partners are also involved in these projects. Cigcognani then turned the spotlight to some of the teamâs prominent artists, featuring the teamâs international reach. Including Marcus Nyberg, who is bringing a rejuvenated Stockholm Arlanda to MSFS from Prepar3D - decked out with brand new texturing to take advantage of the simulatorâs rendering capabilities. Nyberg documents his progress on the project on a facebook page which can be accessed here: Arlanda Journal.

Here are some of the highlights from the developments:

Another Nordic artist, Finn Hansen, has taken on another Scandinavian airport, bringing a bespoke rendition of Oslo to the platform. Projected to be completed by the middle of this year, progress has been steady for the most part:

Another associate, Andreas Hegi is working on Bolzano Airport, know for being the primary entry into the Dolomites. From the images it appears that the developer has recently made strides in developing the interior of the terminal complex:Â 

On the note of interior modeling, Cicognani turns her attention to Rasha Tucakov, who is bringing the same Orbx detailing to the Balkans development is wrapping up for LYPG Podgorica:Â 

Moving to the US, developer Matteo Veneziani is currently putting a new coat of paint on KBUR Burbank for MSFS in the same fashion as Nyberg of Arlanda, this follows closely after his recent work on LKSK Skiathos. Burbank will feature reworked models, textures, and new ground work. The MSFS development will serve to be the basis for the X-Plane port (with discounts for MSFS owners once the XP version is out). Following this, Veneziani will hop to Australia to revisit Gold Coast and wrap up LIPH Treviso.In the same continent as Gold Coast, developer Ken Hall is building a rendition of YMLT Launceston:

Â Hopping over to neighboring New Zealand, developer Tim Harris is chipping away at NZNV Invercargill, with his photorealistic approach to texturing:

On the mesh side of things, the son of Orbxâs Global lead developer, Dmytro Krikunov, is putting the finishing touches on the highly anticipated New Zealand Mesh update, which features 1m LiDAR in selected areas, his efforts will continue into South America after NZ.

This wraps up the rewind from Orbx as the team gears up with another productive year of releases. For the original update, please visit the forum post.</summary>

    <title>ToLiss Releases Minor Update for A340</title>
    <updated>2022-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

X-Plane aircraft developer ToLiss has recently released an update for its popular A340-600. This new version, V1.0.3, brings new features such as improved engine models as well as an array of bug fixes that range from repairing the sounds and particle effects to readjusting the flight directors on takeoff rotation.

According to ToLiss's post, v1.0.3 will not be bringing any major updates, rather it is an opportunity for the developer to patch up various reported bugs while introducing a few minor changes. Most notably, an improved engine model has been included, allowing pilots to "see through the bypass channel as in real life". Additionally, the aircraft will now give pilots the option to "automatically re-engage NAV mode" during a go around procedure. Finally, the new version also implements nurmous bug fixes, including range limited MCDU CI entry and "improved default wing flex magnitude". For the full changelog for v1.0.3, check out the developer's Facebook post.

ToLiss's A340, released in October last year, is a sophisticated simulation of the iconic Airbus aircraft. It features highly detailed systems, accurate 3D modeling, and a custom designed FMGS that reflects the operations of its real world counterpart. For additional information on the aircraft, head over to a previous Threshold article.

Currently, owners of the product can update their A340 via the SkunkCrafts Updater or by redownloading the aircraft from their store of purchase. For prospective users, a copy of the Airbus can be purchased on the X-Plane.org Store for $89.99.</summary>
