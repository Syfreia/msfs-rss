    <summary>Sim: DCS. Grinelli Designs has recently published a new development update on their upcoming F-100D Super Sabre Module for DCS concerning its current 3D modeling progress, sound design, and future development plans.Â   They have used advanced 3D scanning techniques and photogrammetry to obtain precise measurements, shapes, and textures of the exterior and cockpit, which were then sent to their modeling team to be used as a reference for their work.  Grinelli Designs has also recorded many cockpit sounds to enhance the productâs audio experience.  The current development progress is said to be steadily moving forward, with the airplane in a flyable state and with many advancements in the flight model, engine, fuel, and hydraulic systems, while also actively testing and refining the core systems of the aircraft.  Even though the addition of the 3D scans has improved the accuracy and fidelity of their upcoming product, they claim thereâs more work to be done: continuous refinement of the exterior and interior, flight model tweaks, the implementation of a weapon system, and adding more liveries and customization options. They also claim they have been collaborating with real-world F-100D pilots and experts and actively listening to their insights and knowledge.  They finish the development update with a link to theirÂ progress tracker, where people can see how far they have come with the development so far.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimWorks Studios has published a development update on their upcoming Pilatus PC-12 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator.  The update previews multiple features that will be included with the plane, as well as a tentative release window for the highly anticipated aircraft.  â SWS reports that the executive cabin for the aircraft is now fully functional, with realistic cabin, flood, and reading lights being implemented. All the tray tables, seats, and armrests are also fully modeled and the drawers will close if the aircraft is banked too much. For the exterior, the update details that engine covers that are in addition to the Angle of Attack and pitot vane covers. Along with that, the "Remove Before Flight" tags on the covers will react to external forces such as aircraft slope, through a simulated gravity vector, and react to wind direction and speed.  â The aircraft is around two weeks from completion, and if all goes well, SimWorks Studios plans to send it to Pilatus to verify that that the aircraft's systems and flight model act just like the real aircraft.  â The team says that they are planning a mid-September release, as they are taking a two week break from August 14th through the 25th, and they want to give enough time to fix any bugs that their testing team, or Pilatus might find. As with many projects, this release window is subject to change. Whenever the release date is, Threshold will keep you updated, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  FS2Crew has recently released their first AI-powered animated first officer add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator, an expansion pack for their Flybywire A32NX FS2Crew.Â   â The developers claim it has been something people wanted for a long time, but it was impossible in FSX and P3D because of technological limitations. MSFS, on the other hand, makes the âdreamâ come true with an AI co-pilot that can interact with the pilot and the aircraft.  The animated first officer will perform realistic cabin flows and checklists and physically interact with the environment, clicking on everything like you would expect a real first officer to.  They have included two videos from different content creators showcasing how the product works in practice:  Itâs available on theirÂ official websiteÂ for roughly $16.52 (on sale).

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released their rendition of MontrÃ©al-Trudeau International Airport (CYUL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving greater Montreal and eastern Ontario with a yearly average of 16 million passengers.  It opened in 1941, replacing Saint-Hubert Airport - Montrealâs former airport - considered inadequate for the cityâs needs into the 40s and beyond. It was constructed on land that once was a race track, chosen for its size and generally good weather conditions throughout the year. It also doubled as a military airport for almost twenty years.  In the 70s, the government planned on replacing it with a new, much larger airport - Montreal Mirabel -, then the largest in the world, repurposing YUL as a domestic airport. The whole project was centered around traffic growth that never happened for many reasons, which consequently caused the decline of both Montreal airports over the following decades.  The inconvenience of Mirabel grew larger and larger, to the point they decided to resume international operations in Montreal-Trudeau again in 1997 and charter flights in 2004 (and Mirabel ceased passenger operations entirely in 2004).Â   Itâs a hub for Air Canada (Barcelona, BogotÃ¡, Brussels, Calgary, Casablanca, Delhi, Denver, Edmonton, Fort-de-France, Frankfurt, Geneva, Halifax, HoustonâIntercontinental, Lisbon, LondonâHeathrow, Los Angeles, Lyon, Mexico City, Miami, MilanâMalpensa, ParisâCharles de Gaulle, Pointe-Ã -Pitre, Providenciales, RomeâFiumicino, San Francisco, San JosÃ© de Costa RicaâJuan SantamarÃ­a, SÃ£o PauloâGuarulhos, Tampa, TokyoâNarita, TorontoâPearson, Toulouse, Vancouver, Winnipeg), Air Transat (CancÃºn, Cayo Coco, Fort Lauderdale, HolguÃ­n, Lisbon, LondonâGatwick, Lyon, MÃ¡laga, Marseille, Miami, Montego Bay, Orlando, ParisâCharles de Gaulle, Port-au-Prince, Puerto Plata, Puerto Vallarta, Punta Cana, SamanÃ¡, Santa Clara, TorontoâPearson, Varadero), and OWG (Cayo Coco, HolguÃ­n, Santa Clara, Varadero), flying passengers all over the globe.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with LiDAR airport elevation data, custom satellite imagery covering the airport and its surroundings, custom ground polygons, handcrafted 3D models of buildings, jetways, and facilities, realistic night lighting, and more.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $18.70, requiring at least 5.09 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier, developer Orbx has announced on their social media platforms that they will be bringing their London City (EGLC) scenery to X-Plane 12.  London City Airport is located 6 miles east of the city of London in the Borough of Newham and sees on average 4 million passengers each year. The airport features just one runway, which also acts as the main taxiway. The short runway, steep approach angles, and strict noise abatement rules mean that the list of aircraft that service the airport is quite limited. Currently, the airport has flights offered by British Airways, ITA Airways, KLM, Loganair, LOT, Lufthansa, Luxair, and Swiss International.  Orbx included preview images of the scenery that highlighted the airportâs terminal and some recognisable buildings that can be seen around the airport. Orbx originally released the current version of EGLC for Microsoft Flight Simulator earlier this year. While no release date has been announced be sure to keep an eye on Threshold for any updates that may come.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Parallel42 has announced the release of Bluffers Hill after seeing the popularity of Sharktooth Ridge. Bluffers Hill is located near Red Bluff, CA and is completely surrounded by bluffs and nearby sandbars. Parallel42 has used a 3D library of ground assets along with their own custom terraforming which overwrites the default MSFS terrain which in turn produces a better more realistic terrain for pilots. Bluffers Hill dares pilots to attempt its challenging approach, dangerous sloped runway and no safe option for a go-around. This brings a challenge to even the best pilots out there. Bluffers Hill is suited best to STOLÂ aircraft and any bush planes you have in your hangar. Included is a whole host of features which really bring this area to life when you fly here.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  NMG Simulations has recently released their rendition of King Shaka International Airport (FALE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the South African city of Durban with a yearly average of 4.3 million passengers.  The airport was idealized in the 1970s, but its opening only happened in 2010 due to a multitude of reasons. When the original construction work started in the mid-1970s, the project was halted due to economic reasons, with only the earthworks and its drainage system reaching completion. There was a revival attempt in the late 1990s, but new operational challenges appeared, such as its original 2700m runway, which was deemed too short.  After much deliberation and environmental impact studies, the airportâs construction resumed in 2007, with completion achieved by late 2009, when operational testing began.Â   It ultimately replaces Durban International Airport - now a military-only airport - as Durbanâs main airport, served by Airlink, CemAir, Emirates, Eswatini Air, FlySafair, LIFT, Proflight Zambia, Qatar Airways, South African Airways, TAAG Angola Airlines, and Turkish Airlines.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail buildings, custom-made lighting, AI traffic compatibility, custom ground textures, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.84, requiring at least 104.63 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Langkawi International Airport (WMKL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Langwaki and Peris in Malaysia with a yearly average of 3 million passengers.  It started as an airfield for the Japanese Army in 1945, only becoming a passenger airport in the late 80s after a huge effort by the Malaysian government to develop Langkawi as a major tourist destination.  It was then upgraded to international standards in 1991 and expanded in 2018 to accommodate up to 4 million passengers annually.  AirAsia (Johor Bahru, Kuala LumpurâInternational, Penang, Singapore), Batik Air Malaysia (Kuala LumpurâSubang, Kuala LumpurâInternational), Firefly (Kuala LumpurâSubang, Penang), Malaysia Airlines (Kuala LumpurâInternational), MYAirline Â (Kuala LumpurâInternational), and Scoot (Singapore) serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, custom ground textures, a 3D model of the Maha Tower, and custom night lighting.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Dallas Love Field (KDAL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area with a yearly average of 16 million passengers.  It opened 105 years ago as a training camp for World War 1 pilots and then converted into a storage facility for surplus aircraft after the war, with traffic reducing massively through that period.  It was purchased by the city of Dallas in 1928 and opened for civilian use, with its first set of paved runways coming four years after its grand reopening.  The first passenger terminal was built in 1940, serving over 21 weekday departures from American, Braniff, and Delta.  World War 2 saw the airport become a training school for army pilots, returning to its civil applications after the war.  The increased demand for air travel in the 1950s led to an expansion, with a new terminal (T3) designed by Donald S. Nelson, sporting three concourses, 26 gates, and the worldâs first moving walkways.  Currently, the airport has a single terminal with 20 gates, with Alaska and Delta Air Lines having one each and Southwest Airlines having full control over the remaining 18. Unsurprisingly, Southwest has 95.3% of the passenger market share, while Delta and Alaska have 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly-detailed PBR models, custom ground poly, custom ground textures, custom animated jetways, custom night lighting, and an updated AFCAD.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.11, requiring at least 715.23 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

The update comes nearly 3 years after the last update which was released in August of 2020. Self-Loading Cargo aims to add another layer of realism for users who are looking for a more airline-focused experience in their chosen simulator. The name is based on what some pilots jokingly give their passengers. The app was extremely popular when it was first released in August of 2019 and received many updates during its first year of release. Lanilogic stated the reason for the lack of updates or announcements in the last three years is due to personal reasons and was very apologetic while promising to have more open communication about updates to his product moving forward.Â  Version 1.6 brings a ton of new features including voice commands and ground crew simulation. The ground crew integration includes interaction at both departure and arrival airports, a completely regionalized sound pack, and a completely integrated pushback system that includes support for both 'hotel' and single-engine taxi modes. Ground crew interactions can be initiated by either voice commands or through the updated UI. Along with the update, many existing features have also been updated including a complete rework of the pilot scoring and passenger satisfaction systems. The developer states that now instead of passenger satisfaction being rated by a simple percentage, you'll receive updates both in real-time and as an overall opinion of the flight based on things like the smoothness of the flight as well as the timing of announcements. Additionally, both the flight crew and cabin sound packs have been completely reworked to include new sounds as well as the ability to use different languages. The update also comes with a small price increase from Â£12.99 to Â£16.99. The developer states the price increase is the result of rising operational costs as well as the added functionality of the software. This price increase is only applicable to new purchases though and customers with existing licences are free to download version 1.6 without any additional costs.Â  â Be sure to stay tuned as Threshold brings you the latest in flight sim news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. CanadianFlightSimStudios has recently released their rendition of Niagara District Airport (CYSN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a general aviation airport serving the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake in Ontario, Canada.  The St. Catharines Flying Club initially established the airport in March 1929, although in a different location (it was relocated in 1935 to its present location). It was then heavily utilized by the RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force) during World War II for pilot training, where they also built basic infrastructure (hangars, barracks, and a control tower).Â   It was then returned to civilian use after the war, growing continuously, featuring three runways, a terminal building, multiple hangars, a flight school, and an aircraft maintenance facility.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom models, PBR texturing, HDR lighting, and an interior for the executive terminal.  Itâs available in theirÂ official shopÂ for roughly $9.74. Shout out to Shenherm for the news scoop! Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
