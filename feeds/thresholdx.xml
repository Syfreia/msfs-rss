    <title>Fenix Begins V2 Rollout</title>
    <updated>2023-08-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fbv2rt" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/64cd3b62a03f0b2cfaf47241_v2header.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="520714"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. This is the first part of a two part announcement by Fenix. You can read the second announcement here. The rollout of the highly anticipated V2 commences. Over the next few days, Fenix plans to initiate this process by pushing a "staging" build. This rollout strategy involves releasing the modules of V2 in two distinct blocks. An exciting milestone has been reached with V2, where certain modules are ready for deployment, independent of any dependencies still under development. In the initial block, referred to as V2 Block 1, the offerings will include FBWv2, FMv2, and the first of the new displays, (ISIS). Additional smaller displays will be introduced later. Users can look forward to all code-side performance optimisations, including the innovative display render technology. Furthermore, a substantial portion of non-dependent avionics improvements across the aircraft, including the brand new VNAV, and a host of bug fixes, will be included. The full changelog will be provided upon rollout. This sets the stage for the second phase of the V2 delivery, projected to conclude by the end of September. Block 2 will comprise the new visual model, IAE and external engine model, further avionics fixes, EFBv2, and any additional revisions or improvements deemed necessary for Block 1.The rationale behind the decision to divide the rollout into two blocks is multifaceted. Block 2 requires additional refinement before it's ready for its prime-time debut. However, Fenix believes that the substantial improvements Block 1 brings to the user experience cannot be held back, especially since the development teams have completed their work on it. Fenix also encourages community feedback on Block 1's features to refine and enhance Block 2, aiming for an optimal overall user experience when V2 is fully delivered. In appreciation for users' patience, Fenix will be releasing some screenshots next week, giving a sneak peek of what they aim to achieve with Block 2, particularly the visual model. The entire aircraft has undergone a painstaking rebuilding process. This endeavor not only raises the bar from what was achieved with the first version but also demonstrates Fenix's commitment to delivering a high-quality product at no additional cost. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. This is the second part of a two part announcement from Fenix, you can see the other announcement here. âIn the world of flight simulation, secrets are hard to keep. Speculations have been brewing, and the big reveal is finally here. While working on revamping the A320 with V2, Fenix has simultaneously been developing the A321 and A319. The improvements made with the rollout of V2 have laid a robust foundation upon which these new aircraft models have been built. Fenix has announced plans to release these new models by the end of the year as a single expansion package, priced at Â£39.99. As with the A320, sharklets will follow at no additional cost to the customers. With the release of Block 2 scheduled for September, the end of the year will witness the debut of the A321 and A319. As Fenix moves into 2024, it plans to update all its product lines with sharklets for free. Timelines are often tricky and met with apprehension. Nevertheless, Fenix believes in the importance of transparency with their customers. It is crucial for them to provide a clear roadmap of their plans and timelines, alleviating the anxiety that can come with uncertainty.A question that might arise is why the A321 and A319 are prioritized over the A320 sharklets. Fenix said the simple answer is financial stability. The new aircraft models' release will ensure the company's steady financial standing, crucial to support continued product line development and future offerings. For the time being, customers are encouraged to enjoy the revised displays, enhanced performance, and improved handling and behaviour of the aircraft. While the next month might seem like a long wait, the company assures its customers that they are diligently preparing the rest of V2. Over the weekend, Fenix will share performance benchmarks for V2 Block 1, detailing the improvements over the .146 version. In a few days, they will provide a changelog and a new build, continuing to keep their customers in the loop of this exciting journey. â</summary>

    <title>Cockspur Releases Cessna C162 Skycatcher for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cockspur has recently released their C162 Skycatcher for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a high-wing tricycle gear light-sport aircraft designed and produced by Cessna between 2009 and 2013.  Its design was unveiled in 2006 during EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, back when they were testing the waters of the commercial feasibility of a light sport aircraft. The development program was launched a year later, kickstarting the development of a production version.  After carrying out all the required testing and passing the ASTM Light Sport Aircraft requirements with flying colors, it was ready to roll out of the factory. In December 2009, the first production Skycatcher had finally been delivered, and the order list was sitting at a thousand units by then.  The plans for 2010 included a 300-400 unit production rate which never came to be, with only 30 deliveries that year, followed by many cancellations in the subsequent years because the aircraft was deemed too expensive for what it was. By 2014, the sales had been halted, and unsold units were scrapped for parts.  Reviews criticized the aircraftâs high empty weight, fragility, and lack of tall-friendliness, feeling even more cramped than a little 152. Many considered it a failed attempt at creating a Light Sport Aircraft, yielding nothing but a miniaturized 152.  Cockspurâs rendition aims to deliver an accurate rendition of the Skycatcher, developed in close connection with real-world pilots. It includes a full glass cockpit, twelve liveries, and more.  Itâs available onÂ Cockspurâs websiteÂ for $22.04 and on the MSFS Marketplace for $19.99. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Northern Sky Studio has recently released their rendition of Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport (PASI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Sitka in Alaska with a yearly average of 38,000 passengers. â The airport was built in 1942 as a military airfield during World War 2, then turned over to the city of Sitka right after it was over and converted into a civilian airport. Scheduled airline service only started a decade later with Pacific Northern Airlines. â The jet age only arrived at Sitka in March 1967, when an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-90C Golden Nugget touched its then gravel runway with 70 passengers. Gravel runway operations were still brand new to jet operators, and the 727 required a specific FAA certification before such a feat.Â  â Historical records say the âwholeâ city came to the airport to watch the landing, including the mayor, governor, and even a high school marching band. One of the employees shot an 8mm film of the landing that the local historical society preserved afterward. â The airport currently has a single terminal with a single jetway, operated mainly by Alaska Airlines, which serves the airport all year long with routes to Juneau and Ketchikan. Delta Connection runs a seasonal leg to Seattle-Tacoma. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed replica of its buildings and vehicles, full PBR materials, texture baking effects on all buildings, high-resolution textures, and custom orthophoto for the airport and surroundings. â â â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.00, requiring at least 1.47 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MLD Scenery has recently released their rendition of TimiÈoara Traian Vuia International Airport (LRTR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in Romania with a yearly average of 1.1 million passengers.  The airport was built in 1942 on a 91-hectare plot of land, originally sporting a 1,200x600m runway, a 9x5m plank cabin with offices, and a 20x8m shed.Â   A decade later, the airport received several upgrades to fit the needs of the Romanian Army, including a runway extension, bringing its length from 1,200 to 2,000 meters.Â   In the 60s, with Timisoaraâs growth becoming more and more evident and transforming the city into an economic center, the government decided to build a proper civil airport on its location, with a big passenger terminal and a 2,500m runway.  It was then modernized in the mid-1970s to meet the new demand for passenger traffic while also getting yet another runway extension. Arad International Airport took all of the Timisoara traffic during the works from 1977 to late 1979 as it only had one runway.  A new terminal for international arrivals was built between 2019 and 2021, further increasing the airportâs passenger handling capabilities.  AirConnect, Corendon Airlines, Eurowings, HiSky, Lufthansa, Sky Express, TAROM, and WizzAir serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, custom ground polygons, an up-to-date layout, custom night lighting, and a custom GSX profile. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.32, requiring at least 1.21 GB of free hard disk space to install.

Yesterday morning, Mathijs Kok reappeared on the Aerosoft Forums under a new account - weeks after announcing his departure from the company after 20 years of service -defending his former company with a statement on how he shaped the forum as he'd enjoy it if he were a customer, and then signing the post as "Mathijs Kok - PMDG Simulations." â As PMDG had not officially announced such a move, the community wondered whether it was an elaborate prank rather than the next big transfer of the flight simulation niche. For a while, there were no answers from either Aerosoft or PMDG, but Robert Randazzo broke the silence, confirming that Mathijs had, in fact, joined PMDG: "I'm personally thrilled to welcome my very long-time friend, Mathijs, to the PMDG team. I'll have more to say on this topic a bit later - and I may or may not shine a light on some of what we'll have him doing as part of our expansion going forward". "Anticipate him hanging back a bit while he gains his footing and gets up-to-speed. Our culture is very different from the one he has left behind after two decades- and his role here will be quite a bit different as well. There are a few key moments in PMDG's history- and it has been 15 years since we made specific, positive changes to improve the wider skill level and capabilities of our team. Mathijs coming aboard the PMDG team is one of numerous changes taking place in the background that go a long way toward my strategic objectives for PMDG- and I assure you you will be excited when you see what that plan looks like.", he concluded. â â Mathijs himself had also made an appearance on PMDG's forum, thanking everyone for the support and explaining his decision to leave Aerosoft after so many years: "As a project manager, you have a task and resources, and they were not well aligned in my opinion. Aerosoft in 2023 is also a very different company than it was when I joined". "When he (Robert Randazzo) offered me to join his team, I did not hesitate. I did not even think about it. It feels like an adventure. One that is very welcome and really reinvigorated my love for the hobby and its users", he added. â â Then, he stated how PMDG's structure suits his style better, with no sales department or marketing office aiming exclusively at production and sales happening almost automatically in response to a great product. â Threshold will keep you informed on the matter may Robert Randazzo reveal his new position at PMDG.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Ponta Delgada - JoÃ£o Paulo II Airport (LPPD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the municipality of Ponta Delgada in the Archipelago of the Azores with a yearly average of 2 million passengers.  The airport's construction started in 1963, with the official inauguration only happening six years later in 1969 by President AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s. Its primary purpose was serving inter-island connections and Europe, with regular flights to Lisbon beginning a year later.  A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1995 when the airport also got its current name after the Pope's visit to the Azores four years prior.  The following decade post-new terminal brought massive growth in passenger traffic, which has been steadily growing, connecting the Azores to the world.  Azores Airlines, Binter Canarias, British Airways, Edelweiss Air, Iberia, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SATA Air AÃ§ores, Smartwings, Swiss, TAP, Transavia, TUI fly Belgium, TUI fly Netherlands, and United Airlines all serve it, with most of them only offering their services during summer. It's also the most important cargo airport in the archipelago, handling over 10,000 tonnes yearly.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, hand-made textures, custom POIs, true-to-life landside recreation, a detailed terminal interior, an official GSX profile, and more.  It's available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.55, requiring at least 3.06 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
