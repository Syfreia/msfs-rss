    <summary>Sim: MSFS. ST Simulations recently released their rendition of Gazipasa-Alanya Airport (LTFG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving the city of GazipaÅa (Turkey) and its surroundings, it averages 500.000 passengers every year (pre-pandemic), visited by airlines such as AnadoluJet, Finnair, Scandinavian and Turkish.Â  The construction finished in 1999, but it only opened in 2010, after TAV Airport (Tepe Akfen Ventures) won the bid to operate the airport for 25 years. Itâs famous for being the only airport in Turkey with a highway passing right under it. With a terminal area of 6700 square meters, it has an annual capacity of 1,500,000 passengers.Â  The scenery features advanced terraforming to replicate the highway tunnel, an accurate terminal replica and taxiway layout, custom models, PBR textures, and many airport buildings. Itâs available on FlightSim.to for $12.50 and requires at least 323 MB of free disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. With X-Plane 12, there have come many improvements from the previous versions of X-Plane. Notably in Xplane 11, the built-in ATC function was somewhat lacking depth, this has been addressed and overhauled with an all-new system for XP12!Â  In a post on the X-plane website, Laminar Research discusses about the various ATC system improvements in their most recent version of the X-Plane series.Â Â  New features include:Â  Perhaps the most significant improvement to the ATC system however is the addition of global regions, X-Plane will now follow procedures and use voices that are suitable for different regions of the world. This is a huge improvement on the previous system which in essence treated the entire world as if it followed FAA procedures.Â  Another big improvement to the built-in ATC system is the quality of VHF communications, this will now change, taking into account your distance from the controller, relative altitude, the type of controller, and any blocking terrain that may be around you.Â  The ATC dialogue menu has also received an overhaul making it more intuitive.Â  This is a big step in the right direction to improving the overall experience with Xplane, although many agree from participating in the latest public beta, it still has a long way to go.Â  â Threshold will keep you up to date with all the latest news! </summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Origami Studios has worked hard to get this project released in the last two days after announcing its development for X-Plane 12. London Heathrow (EGLL) is the busiest airport in the United Kingdom and within the top 10 in the world! Founded in 1946 and originally known as London Airport, it was renamed London Heathrow in 1966. It used to have six runways, placed in a Star-Of-David pattern. As Heathrow became bigger and bigger over the years, it was decided there was no longer a need for the 3 of Heathrowâs four diagonal runways, culminating on their closure by the 1970âs, leaving one runway intact (05/23), eventually decommissioned in 2003 for an extension of an existing terminal. Itâs the hub for British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, and they cater for many other airlines that fly in and out daily from different countries. It has four passenger terminals which can see over 78 million passengers a year, according to data shown in 2017, heading to and from 185 countries around the world. Fun fact, did you know that aircraft had to be moved from the Terminal 4 remote stands when runway 23 was in use? Origami Studios have brought out a massive asset to X-Plane 12. Including custom buildings, a highly detailed rendition of Terminal 5, landmarks and moving jetways. â Key Features: Want to fly to the busiest UK airport in X-Plane 12?

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently updated their A320 add-on to v1.0.5.139, addressing a significant list of issues, including flare law tweaks, flap behavior, sound fixes, and the return of contrails. There is an in-depth forum postÂ regarding their findings on the landing behavior, including comparisons with real-world data and footage, which can be a worthwhile read for A320 aficionados. The complete changelog follows down below: â [SYSTEM] â - Adjusted custom low speed friction model â - Adjusted G/S mini logic â - Fixed beacon/strobe desync â - Fixed flap 2 to flap 3 excessive nose-down ballooning in manual flight and autoflight. â - Adjusted tuning for G/S hold for better tracking of G/S in autopilot modes â - Autoland told to stop mucking about and do the job properly, should flare a little more aggressively now. â - Fixed issue with loss of ILS signal in the FMS autotuner. This causes lack of yaw control during ROLLOUT, leading to grassy excursions. Please note, it's possible this issue still exists in specific sceneries that do not have their guidance beams set up properly. â - ISA fixed. â - Small tweaks to FLARE mode behaviour. â - Introduction of LIGHTER/HEAVIER sidestick option in CONTROL CONFIG, default changed to "lighter" for desktop hardware.Â  â - Changed amount of force needed to disconnect autopilot with stick pressure. Now a user needs to apply roughly 60% of travel before the AP will disconnect. This is the best way we can emulate a "control lock" which requires a fair amount of force to disconnect. â - Disabled brake temperature simulation for GSX pushbacks. â - Reduced sensitivity of yaw when nose wheel is in contact with the ground, leading to significantly smoother yaw control during crosswind landings and at high speeds. â - Minor refinements to initial VNAV descent angle calculations.Â  â - Fixed issue where the flat deceleration segment for 250kts was missing when a "at or above" altitude constraint was present. â [FM] â - Slight bump to flap full lift, aircraft should feel more responsive in flap full configurations, ergo FLARE feels slightly more energetic now as opposed to throwing elevator up into a bowl of porridge. All in, this should be more consistent, simply put. The prior the lack of lift was causing inertia issues. Please be aware of this on your next approach, some refamiliarization might be required. â - Made a small adjustment to lateral friction values â - Made a small adjustment to ground spoiler effectiveness â [ART&amp;SOUND] â - All exterior lights now volumetric â - Added back missing antennas â - #bringbackcontrails â - Volume bug resolved preventing some sounds from playing at their intended volume â - Fixed nose gear retraction sounds â - Brighter cockpit â - Sound fixes and improvements (flaps/slats/fuel-pumps/AEVC/packs) The update is available on their website for registered customers.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Known developer iniBuilds recently announced and released the v2 version of their in house software iniManager. Featuring many new additions and optimizations for users to enjoy. The iniManager is a software that eases the installation and update process for aircraft and scenery renditions. All while supporting products for both X-Plane 11 and Microsoft Flight Simulator. Recently it was announced that v2 of the software was in the works and it has now been released to the public. The update comes packed full with new features. The software now supports X-Plane 12 and P3D with products coming soon. An all new âWorld Viewâ has been added to display installed scenery packages across the globe, alongside viewing packages available for purchase on the iniBuilds Store. iniManager also now has an in-app purchasing option for those that want an all-in-one access. The software can now install liveries for MSFS aircraft, which will install directly in the Community Folder. Finally a support page for pilots has been added to give more accessibility to SimBrief. It can display your OFP, METARâs and more, all in one place. Version 2 is now available to download for free on iniBuilds Website. If you would like to view the full press release from iniBuilds you can view it on the iniBuilds Forum</summary>
