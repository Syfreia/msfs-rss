    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Arif Studio has recently released their rendition of Chicago Executive Airport (KPWK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a public airport serving northwestern Chicago with a yearly average of 108,000 aircraft movements.  It opened in 1925 as Gauthierâs Flying Field in the village of Wheeling (Cook County, Illinois), purchased and developed by George J. Priester in 1953, who installed paved runways, lighting, hangars, and an ATC tower. It was then sold in 1986 by Georgeâs son, Charlie, to the city of Prospect Heights and Wheeling, when it was renamed Palwaukee Municipal Airport. â The current name was given in late 2006 after trustees from the village voted to approve a name change, better positioning the airport as a private aviation gateway to Chicago due to its proximity to the city. â â According to 2022 data, 80% of the yearly movements correspond to general aviation traffic, 20% to air taxi, and less than 1% are military. There are 296 aircraft based at the airport. â â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a recreation of all the hangars, numerous static objects, landside buildings, non-PBR texturing for file size optimization, custom night lighting, and more. â â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $8.52, requiring at least 31.18 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  ATTBEN has recently released their rendition of Kajaani Airport (EFKI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Kajaani town in the Finnish region of Kainu, with a yearly average of 85,200 passengers.  The airport was built in 1939, but the official opening only happened 17 years later because of World War 2 and its short-term economic consequences.Â   â It has been majorly domestic, with a healthy start followed by a decline in the 1980s as a direct consequence of the economic recession and airline industry deregulation.Â  â The 90s brought a ârevivalâ with the popularization of low-cost carriers and the growth of the tourism industry in Finland.  â A new - environmentally friendly - terminal was built in the early 1990s, designed to be energy-efficient and sustainable. It won the Finavia Airport of the Year the following year and went on to win again in 1999 and 2007. â Finnair serves it with a flight to Helsinki-Vantaa. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR materials, a detailed interior environment, custom baggage carts, custom clutter, a true-to-life runway profile and elevation, custom night lighting, and performance-friendly optimization.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Skyline Simulations recently released the X-Plane 12 version of their John Wayne Airport (KSNA), serving Orange County with a yearly average of 11.3 million passengers.  â It started as an airstrip in 1923 and was purchased by the County of Orange in 1939, which has owned it ever since.Â  â After a brief period of Military usage during World War 2, it was returned to the County with the condition it remained open for all kinds of aviation uses. â  A passenger terminal was built in 1967, with 2,000 square meters of total built area, accommodating up to 400,000 passengers annually. It was expanded in 1974, 1980, and 1982, adding 700 square meters. â Eight years after the last terminal expansion, the Thomas F. Riley Terminal replaced the aging terminal with a 31,390 square meter facility that could handle millions of passengers. â It was then further expanded in 2011, part of a $543 million project that added a new terminal C with six additional gates and a new parking lot. â Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JSX, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, United Express, and WestJet serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with UHD textures, detailed 3D modeling, PBR materials on every building, custom orthoimagery, thousands of custom static objects, custom night lighting, ground traffic, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.68, requiring at least 678.37 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MagMexico has recently released their rendition of Tijuana International Airport (MMTJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the San Diego-Tijuana transborder agglomeration with a yearly average of 12.3 million passengers. â It was inaugurated in 1951 as âAeropuerto Federal de Tijuana,â with a 2000-meter long runway and a single passenger terminal, that was eventually replaced in 1970 by a much bigger one, part of a $8.7 million project that also included a runway lengthening. â In the 1980s, Tijuana was the fastest-growing city in Mexico, which led to further expansions in that decade. â The airport was privatized in 1995, becoming part of the Pacific Airport Group, which consists of 12 airports, with its headquarters in Guadalajara.Â  â Under the new helm, it was expanded and renovated in 2002, with many changes to accommodate the Boeing 747. By then, Tijuana was one of the most important airports in Mexico. â A cross-border express bridge was inaugurated in late 2015, allowing passengers to access the airport directly from the United States, with a North American terminal. â AeromÃ©xico, American Eagle, Calafia Airlines, Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n, Viva Aerobus, and Volaris serve the airport. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, animated jetways, dynamic lighting, detailed hangars and buildings, custom ground textures, precise AFCAD, static aircraft and vehicles, animated radar facilities, native volumetric grass and vegetation, and more.Â  â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $21.26, requiring at least 1.24 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlightFX has recently released their rendition of DuPage Airport (KDPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a general aviation airport serving the city of West Chicago, Illinois, with a yearly average of 135,000 aircraft movements. â It was built on former sheep-grazing land in the late 1920s by two Chicago entrepreneurs, and the U.S. Army eventually requisitioned it during World War 2 for training purposes. They built hangars and paved two runways, activating it in 1943. The hangar and the runways still exist, although one of the runways is now a taxiway. â Howard Aircraft Corporation opened a factory across the road a year later, in 1944. They built more than 500 aircraft for the military, which was then pushed across the street for testing at the airport.Â  â The airport was sold back to the county for $1 after the war, followed by a post-war boom that led to a new control tower, a new runway, and expansion plans that only came to fruition almost four decades later. â Midwayâs example (being unable to grow because of urban development around it) made the administration hurry to purchase more surrounding land and make it bigger, taking it from 360 hectares to 1,100 hectares by 1992, warranting control over all the property surrounding the runway complex and providing a larger buffer zone.Â  â It has an FBO offering fuel, parking, de-icing, catering, lavatory services, and a little passenger terminal.Â  â 95% of the yearly traffic corresponds to general aviation, 4% to air taxi, and less than 1% to military traffic. There are 255 aircraft based at the airport. â They recently opened a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (C.B.P.) facility on the first floor of the DuPage Flight Center FBO. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, built in coordination with the DuPage Airport Authority, with on-site photography of all major facilities used for reference, custom ground textures, high-resolution photographic textures, custom night lighting, interior modeling of key structures, in-hangar parking spaces, static G.A. and corporate aircraft, reworked landscaping, and ambient lighting improvements. â Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $14.75, requiring at least 2.92 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aamir Thacker, Fenix Simulationsâ CEO, has made an announcement on their Discord regarding the upcoming IAE update for their A320 add-on, initially scheduled for release in September.  After progressing quickly with the CFM external engine model, they have decided to delay the release of the Block 2 update so that users can get both engines with the new model instead of just the IAEs as previously planned.  Their work on the IAE model made them more familiar with external engine development and significantly sped up the process with the CFMs. The new timeframe for the Block 2 update with both engine models is sometime in October.  They have also confirmed an entirely rebuilt cabin for Block 2, with more detail, increased performance, and a lower VRAM footprint. â The Fenix A320 is available on theirÂ websiteÂ for roughly $60.98, requiring at least 1.8 GB of free hard disk space.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. WF Scenery Studio has recently released their rendition of Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (ZGGG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Guangzhou and Foshan with a yearly average of 40.2 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in China. â The airport opened 19 years ago, replacing the former Baiyun Airport (from 1932), which was deemed too small for the predicted passenger figures and unable to be expanded because of urban development around its area. It was built 28 kilometers north of the city, making it immune to curfews and noise restrictions, thus allowing it to operate 24 hours a day.  â It features two terminals, with Terminal 1 having three concourses and Terminal 2 - opened recently - being one of the worldâs largest terminal facilities with 808,700 square meters.Â  â Itâs a hub for 9 Air, China Southern Airlines, FedEx Express, Hainan Airlines, and Shenzhen Airlines. As the busiest airport in China, the visitors list is quite substantial and mainly from Asia.Â  â Â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, animated jetways, dynamic lights, custom ground markings, and more. â Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $25.31, requiring at least 5.64 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has announced that their next project is Southampton Airport (EGHI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. After initially teasing their next project a few weeks ago with a few screenshots, many eagle-eyed simmers in the community deduced that it was Southampton in the United Kingdom. That was officially confirmed today with a post by iniBuilds on their forum.Â  Southampton Airport was originally built in World War 1 for the Royal Flying Corps, and in 1917, was handed over to the United States Navy Air Service for a short period of time. It also served in a critical role for ground and air training for the Royal Navy in World War 2. It was also the site of the first flight of the Supermarine Spitfire. In the modern era, the airport is a hub for regional and international travel, and is home to many airlines including British Airways, easyJet, Aer Lingus, and Loganair. It also serves many operations to and from the Channel Islands. In their announcement, iniBuilds said that: âWe have gone into extreme detail into this scenery and you can see that we have covered a lot of detail in all areas of the airport.â They also provided an explanation on why they picked Southampton, mainly because many on their scenery team, including their Head of Scenery Development are based in Southampton. Also in their announcement, iniBuilds provided a list of features that can be expected with the upcoming scenery, which include: â They also included a trailer for the airport:  â The scenery will be released on Friday, September 29th with a price of Â£12.99 excl. VAT, or $15.86 USD. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
