    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has recently teased the progress on the upcoming update for their Porto Alegre Salgado Filho International Airport (SBPA) scenery, serving the city of Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It is the ninth busiest airport in the country, with nearly 8 million passengers yearly (pre-pandemic).  Originally called SÃ£o JoÃ£o Federal Airport, it was just an air club, with its first flights dating back to 1923. It saw commercial action for the first time in 1932, when VARIG (the oldest Brazilian airline) replaced their seaplanes with land airplanes, adopting Porto Alegre as their hub. It took eight years for the commission of an actual passenger terminal. Its current name was adopted in 1952, after Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, a local politician who had died a year prior (air crash).  Itâs a focus city for Azul Brazilian Airlines, with a significant domestic network (fifteen destinations) and international legs to Punta del Este and Montevideo (Uruguay). The other two Brazilian giants, GOL Linhas AÃ©reas (thirteen domestic destinations) and LATAM Brasil (5 domestic destinations), are also regularly seen around POA. TAP Air Portugal is the sole European visitor, coming from Lisbon.  Not much was said other than the pictures themselves and the fact itâs still undergoing development.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, developer ToLiss announced the A320 NEO as their next product for X-Plane. The aircraft will mark yet another addition to the already impressive ToLiss Airbus fleet that includes the A319, A321, and A340. â From the teaser picture that accompanied the announcement, it can be seen that the exterior modeling of the aircraft has already been completed, including the brand new engines that distinguishes the NEO from the other A320 variants.  ToLiss has only released limited information regarding the NEO. Therefore, it is unclear whether the A320 NEO will receive a cockpit completely modeled from the ground up or one thatâs derived from that of the A321 and A319. It is also not known if Toliseâs NEO will feature both the CFM Leap and the PW1000G engine options. â Currently, a firm release date is yet to be disclosed but the A320 is expected to come out sometime in March of this year. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

Itâs the fourth busiest airport in the country, with a yearly average of 140 thousand passengers.Â   The airport sees most of its commercial traffic during the summer season, when Ryanair and Smartwings offer four destinations in total. Military traffic makes up most of the year-long traffic, with a NATO A332 constantly visiting from Eindhoven in the Netherlands.Â   Pardubice got a new terminal and apron expansion in 2017, increasing its passenger capacity and handling larger aircraft such as the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737. It was named after Jan Kaspar, an icon of Czech aviation.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of Pardubice Airport, with orthoimagery around the whole area, optimized dynamic lighting, and performance friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.87, requiring at least 522 MB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The flight simulation community has seen the emergence of a new developer group, CreatorOfWorldS (COWS). The team has generated significant interest with their first product in production, the Diamond DA42 aircraft, a highly detailed and accurate replica of the aircraft. Early previews of the product have generated excitement among enthusiasts and professionals alike when shared on social media. Their first public appearance was under another name. We covered the quartet of developers "Simmy Aircraft" for their first debut in an earlier article. COWS has stated that their primary goal is to provide products that will aid in training and simulation opportunities for students and consumers. They have put a lot of effort into replicating the flight behaviour and systems through real aircraft testing and feedback. The development team comprises four members, one of which is Mitchell, who is in charge of creating the meticulously crafted 3D model of the plane. He had direct access to a DA42 throughout the development process, which means that everything about the model has been created based on manuals, pictures, first-hand experience, and a lot of passion for the project. Another team member, Jacob, is responsible for everything under the hood. He has carefully recreated the flight model, electrics, fuel, engine control units, and de-ice system based on the aircraft's manuals and first-hand experience flying the real-life counterparts. The flight model has been tuned to match performance tables accurately, and the result is so close to the real plane that it can be handled just as it would in the real world. Boris is in charge of creating the sounds for the aircraft. He is known for his work in the flight simulation community, being in charge of audio at FlyByWire, and having created sound packs for the DA42 in Microsoft Flight Simulator and other sound packs for other aircraft. To create realistic sounds for the COWS' DA42, Boris has recorded real aircraft sounds and incorporated them into the simulator to ensure a truly immersive user experience. With Peter at the helms of reason, administrative tasks, branding and 3D work assistance, the four members sum up the current team. The COWS DA42 is equipped with a fully custom Garmin G1000NXi avionics system. This system has been created using a combination of manuals, first-hand experience, and Garmin software in order to make it as accurate as possible to the real-world version of the system. The system includes simulation of many of the features of the real Garmin, such as the GPS satellite constellation, profile saving and copying, persistent settings, and system statuses. The system also includes simulations of other systems, such as the PFD, AHRS, ADC, GTX335R, and GMU. Currently, the only features that remain to be added to the simulation are custom flight planning with custom LNAV/VNAV and maps. The system also has the capability to remember user settings. It allows for per-livery, and per-aircraft configurations, giving users the ability to customise their avionics package to their preferences.  The video is a demonstration of the fully custom G1000NXi from COWS own press release. â â The development is still ongoing, and the team is working hard to bring the DA42s to the flight simulation community. No timeline is given, but they are dedicated to ensuring no stone is left unturned and bringing the best DA42s they can offer their users. However, as the team put it, it will take them a little more time to finish everything and ensure everything is perfect. In their press release, COWS mention that their next project will be the DA40-180 XLS, after their DA42 series.  To follow their progress, you can join their discord.  â</summary>
