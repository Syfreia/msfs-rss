    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has taken to their website and Facebook to provide a comprehensive update on all projects expected for release next year. The news bulletin covers all projects, indicating that Just Flight has almost every corner of the aviation market covered for the coming year. From general aviation to heavy airliners, it is evident that next year will be a busy one for Just Flight. The team has outlined a list of aircraft in production, all slated for release in the upcoming year. Starting with the highly-anticipated release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Just Flight vows to commit to ensuring product compatibility and development for Asobo's upcoming simulator. Airliner projects were thoroughly covered with updates and new previews, such as the A300B4 Professional, which was revealed at FS Expo last year. The team is diligently working on finishing the extensive texturing of the flight deck and exterior model, paying attention to every imaginable detail, including a reworked modeling of the nose section of the aircraft. System coding has made significant progress, with the completion of the electrical, air bleed, air conditioning, pressurization, APU, and fuel systems. These systems, like their real-life counterparts, will respond to environmental factors. Progress is ongoing, with the team aiming to provide every detail, down to individual weathered texturing for screw heads. Updates don't stop with the A300, as the RJ Professional is next in line to be released. Just Flight reports significant progress in coding and systems completion, highlighting new systems matching differences between the older 146 and the more modern RJ. Visually, the RJ will feature a high-density 3+3 layout with a full range of animations and sounds. A preview of the cabin is provided below.  The F70/100 Professional is also making progress, with a current focus on reworked texturing from new reference photographs, ensuring an unprecedented level of detail. Various details, such as certain switches and knobs, have been remodeled. The progress continues with animations, lighting, and systems integration.  Finally, an update to the 146 Professional is expected early next year, including the UNS-1 FMS and a reworked detailed cabin from the RJ Professional. This update is currently under beta testing, with more information expected closer to release. Furthermore, the Blue Bird Simulations' 757 is still scheduled for next year, with Just Flight stating that the team is "also incredibly busy" working on the "flying pencil." Just Flight covered general aviation projects, starting with the Piston and Turbine Duke by Black Square, nearing completion. Thandra Designs will collaborate with Just Flight to update their X-Plane 11 fleet to X-Plane 12 standards, utilizing all available features of the simulator. The Duchess, being the first on XP12 list, will feature 8k textures and modern texturing effects inside out. Animations will also be reworked, with reactive animations responding to G-forces and air resistance. Additionally, Just Flightâs new EFB will make it to the X-Plane 12 model, providing controls over airframe features. This update aims to breathe new life into the X-Plane version of the Duchess. Not all projects are progressing as well as hoped, with the Tomahawk project facing setbacks. Just Flight stated that the Tomahawk project stalled but is now at the center of their attention, bringing it in line for their next GA aircraft release for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The in-house team is working on upgrading the interior and exterior modeling and texturing, as well as systems. Expect fully functional avionics stacks, including the GMA340, SL20, SL40, the GX28 transponder, as well as GPS options. On the military side, Just Flightâs Tornado GR1 for MSFS is also making progress. The "Tonka" is being worked on by the same team that brought us the incredibly detailed Avro Vulcan. The same level of detail and passion is being applied to the Tornado. The team has remodeled many parts of the aircraft to bring higher detail and accuracy, with texturing receiving highly detailed 8k treatment as well. Coding is next on the team's list. The Tornado team will be tasked with transferring the Hi-Fi code from the Prepar3D Tornado to MSFS. During the transfer, new features and improvements will be added to bring as much operational accuracy to the real aircraft as possible. Also, Expect 24 paint schemes to be released with the Tornado. Just Flight is wrapping up and preparing for a busy 2024 for the flight sim community, with releases covering all spans of aviation. They express gratitude to the community for its support throughout 2023 and wish everyone a "Very Merry Christmas and health and happiness in the New Year."

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Dubai International Airport (OMDB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fifth busiest airport in the world with a yearly average of 88 million passengers. â It was opened in 1960 after one year of construction work, with a 1,800-meter runway made of compacted sand, which was enough for most airplanes. Three years later, they began constructing an asphalt runway with 2,800 meters of total extension, followed by the construction of hangars, installation of navigational aids, and passenger terminal improvements.  To prepare for the wide bodies in the 1970s, a new terminal was built with an enclosed floor area of 13,400 square meters. Then, the existing asphalt runway was lengthened to 3,810 meters, along with some upgrades to allow the operation of Boeing 747s and Concordes. The second runway opened in April 1984.  Terminal 2 opened in 1998 as part of the 1997 development master plan. The second stage, Terminal 3, began in 2004 and reached completion four years later, with a two-year delay and a cost of 4.55 billion USD.Â   The arrival of the Airbus A380 led to a $230 million investment in adapting some of the stands for the aircraft. Concourse 3 followed soon after, increasing the passenger handling capabilities to 79 million a year.  Itâs a hub for Air India Express, Emirates, FedEx Express, flydubai, and IndiGo. The visitorsâ list includes Aegean Airlines, Aeroflot, Air Canada, Air France, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Cebu Pacific, China Eastern, China Southern, Cyprus Airways, Eurowings, Finnair, Iran Air, KLM, Korean Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Smartwings, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, and Wizz Air.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a hand-crafted ground poly, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, correct taxi signage, an up-to-date layout, custom low-poly static aircraft, LOD optimization for optimal performance, custom GSX profile, and configuration options.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $25.30, requiring at least 4.44 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has recently published the results of their yearly Community Survey, with answers from 23,376 participants worldwide. From the most played flight simulator to the most popular graphics card among flight simmers, they got all our questions covered.  Microsoft Flight Simulator leads the 2023 popularity chart with 70.8% of the respondents using it as their primary flight simulator, followed by X-Plane in second with 13.1%, and Prepar3d in 3rd with 4.6%. The gap has widened compared to 2022, where Microsoft Flight Simulator already had a comfortable lead, but X-Plane 11 had 23% of the respondents playing it frequently, and 12 around 15%. While Navigraph has taken a slightly different approach to quantifying the most popular platform this time, itâs visible that X-Plane has lost a chunk of its relevance in 2023.  Regarding features most valued in an add-on aircraft, 38% of the respondents said aircraft system complexity, followed by realism and authenticity with 26.6%, and flight model accuracy with 17.4%.  The GPU results for this year were relatively surprising, with the RTX 4090 topping the charts at 14.5%, closely followed by the RTX 3080 at 11.5% and the 3080Ti at 10.3%. The only AMD card from the list is labeled âAMD Radeon,â with 4.5% of the respondents owning a GPU from the red team. Nvidia shows clear dominance in the flight sim realm, reflecting their overall lead in the global GPU market.Â   According to the respondents, the best flight simulation release of the year is the PMDG 737 with 11.2%, even though it was not released in 2023, followed by the Fenix A320 with 9.7%, which also was not released this year. A2A Simulationsâ Comanche 250, released in 2023, is third with 8.8%.Â   The most anticipated products for 2024 are the PMDG 777 (29.2%), Fenix A319/20/21 (12.3%), and the FlyByWire A380 (11.3%). Surprisingly, MSFS 2024 sits at 6.6%. On that Flight Sim 2024 note, respondents were asked about their expectations for the upcoming simulator, and 27.9% said performance optimization, 20.2% said improved graphics and realism, and 16.8% wanted weather engine improvements.Â   To check out the full results, please visitÂ this page.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts, well-known for their lineup of Embraer aircraft for X-Plane, have released an update for their E-Jet series. The update focuses mainly on improvements to the autopilot and FMS but also includes many updates to other parts of the planes.  In a post on the X-Plane.org forums, X-Crafts have outlined the new update that has focused on âminor but annoying issues.â The post also teased a large feature update coming in 2024. The full update list contains almost 100 overall changes, and you can find the full list here, but weâll be focusing on what X-Crafts have listed as the main changes. The main focus of this update has been the flight management and autopilot systems and adding functionality that exists in real-world aircraft including things like FLCH now being limited to +2Â° up while climbing and -7Â° in descent, updated approaches that include X and Y designations allowing for users to be able to follow approaches more accurately. An effort has also been made to help the aircraft run more smoothly overall by changing how often the fuel predictions on the FMS progress page updates. Before the update, it would do the calculation every frame, but now, it has now been changed to every 5 seconds allowing for a load on the CPU. The FMS updates also include some quality-of-life fixes with features like the localiser and ground speed selectors staying active after disconnecting the autopilot. X-Crafts have also made changes to the aircraft systems in preparation for the planned steep approach mode, which includes changes such as improved speed brake indications on the EICAS.  X-Crafts are also offering a time-limited discount for those who have purchased either of the V2.5 E-jets. This offer is only valid throughÂ  May 10th, 2024 and grants a 15% discount towards the purchase of the full E-Jets collection, pricing for the different purchase options can be found on the X-Crafts website.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Golden Key Studio (also known as GKS) have released their rendition of the F-111E Ardvark for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The release comes just days after the most recent update on the projectâs development.  Originally developed by General Dynamics in the early 60's, the F-111E, nicknamed the Aardvark, was a pioneer for the development of features that would become a staple of modern combat aircraft. The Ardvark was the first production aircraft to feature variable-sweep wings. The platform also played a pivotal role in the design of modern after-burning engines. The Aardvark first entered service with the USAF in 1967, and the Australian government later purchased the E variant of the F-111. While the RAAF only ever deployed their F-111s as a deterrent, the USAF flew over 4000 combat missions in both the Vietnam and Gulf Wars. The USAF retired their F-111s in 1996 while the RAAF had theirs in active service until 2010.  âGKS promises users of the F-111 will experience an authentic flight model with impressive graphics and a highly detailed cockpit featuring accurate aircraft systems. GKS has kept the development of the Ardvark pretty quiet overall, and while there isnât a ton of information available on their latest offering it is expected that it will be up to the same standard as their MiG-21.

The Airbus A300-600 is an extended version of the A300B2 and B4, with two additional rows of seats, powered by two General Electric CF6-80C2 engines, and making use of the A310 cockpit, with no need for a flight engineer like the older A300s. 313 A300-600s were sold between its inception and 2007, when production stopped.  The add-on features authentic systems, a custom FMS, custom VNAV and LNAV, custom hydraulic, pressurization, electric, and fuel systems, a maintenance system with cautions and warnings triggered by ignoring it, realistic RNAV, and autoland capability. The flight model is tuned to represent the aircraftâs behavior and intricacies accurately.  The textures are PBR and up to 8K quality, with lower texture packs available for lower-end systems. The cockpit and external models for the passenger and cargo variants were entirely reworked.  The sound environment is fully tridimensional, using real recordings of the engine and cabin switches.Â   Additional features include an Electronic Flight Bag, a basic ground handling set, and pre-set cargo loads with visual models.  Itâs important to note that the PW engine variant and CPDLC/ACARS will be available later.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $44.55, requiring at least 8 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Several months ago, we covered a potentially game-changing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) system activated and controlled using your voice. SayIntentions.AI enables users to employ natural language and phraseology commonly used in real-world aviation communications. The primary goal is to provide users with a lifelike, interactive communication experience, making SayIntentions.AI ideal for thoseÂ new to learning aviation radio communications. The team behind SayIntentions.AI, (formerly known as SmartSky.AI) plans to launch the product on January 15th, 2024. Their vision is to "create something that is not only comprehensive but also undeniably more enjoyable to use than flying solo," while addressing the challenge of making live ATC less intimidating. â Since the initial announcement, the team has made significant progress. SayIntentions.AI can now support Class B, C, and D airspaces, providing services such as flight following, radar services, traffic advisories, closed traffic pattern work, Air Traffic Services (ATS), Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), Visual Flight Rules (VFR) transitions, routes, and flight plans for every airport in the United States. Sayintentions.AI works with both X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator with flexibility across both sim platforms. â Additional features include custom voices for specific airports, and controllers will possess their own personalities, adding uniqueness to certain areas. The team outlined various procedures in a Reddit post, including noise abatement procedures and guided directions to specific landmarks as well. â SayIntentions.AI also includes a student pilot mode designed for learning the ropes, with more patient controllers allowing users to ask questions, prompting ATC to provide assistance. The team is fine-tuning the last five percent to achieve the perfect finished state. Pricing details are still in progress, set with a subscription-based service at a monthly rate of possibly $15-20. A trial version will be available around the Lake Tahoe Reno, Nevada area, allowing users to "try before you buy."To learn more about SayIntentions.AI see the Reddit post, website, SayIntention.AI's Discord and check out the demo YouTube video below. You can also sign up for the wait list via SayIntention.AI's website! â â Of course stay tuned to Threshold for more news and updates on SayIntentions.AI!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has broken the silence on New Year's Eve about their long-awaited Block 2 update for their A320 add-on, showcasing the IAE engines, cockpit improvements, new night lighting, and some of the new features that will be part of the update. They have worked around most of the issues they ran through during the development phase, with only weeks separating it from an official release after an eleven-week delay concerning the predicted initial release date.  The new cockpit shows a new - thinner - center window pillar, side windows, and new configuration options, such as the absence of DCDUs, which is typical in North and South America. They have entirely remapped the cockpit textures, cutting the memory footprint in half. Externally, new wings, wingtips, nose, and landing gear are expected, along with a new soft-body physics system for the tires, showing actual compression that will vary with the aircraft's weight.  Physics-driven weathering will also be present in Block 2, with an accurate simulation of the dirt accumulation around the engine and its surroundings.  â The already showcased shadow-casting lights make a return in today's update, showing how it looks with the new V2500s and the many improvements made to the night environment experience inside the cockpit. A deep dive into the new systems and simulation aspects is coming soon.  There's no release date available for the update yet. Threshold will keep you informed on the matter!</summary>
