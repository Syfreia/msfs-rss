    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Eyevionics, a new entrant into the home cockpit space, has been announced. Intended to integrate with MSFS, it brings multiple facets of a glass cockpit to mobile devices like the iPad. Â  â Addressing the lack of any proper glass cockpit solution for MSFS on external monitors, Eyevionics integrates many aspects of the cockpit into one, such as the PFD, MFD, and EFIS. According to the appâs creator, Fabian Lauer, the goal for Eyevionics is âto start an app on one, two, three devices, set up its user interface for the flight you want to fly with a few touches and then just go fly.â  Eyevionics is still in active development, but boasts an ever-growing list of features already implemented into the app, which include: â Many features are still under development for the app, such as: â Eyevionics is planned to release initially with support for iOS, as well as Android tablets, and expect to release sometime in 2024.  For more information, and further announcements, visit eyevionics.eu, or their X (formerly Twitter) account here.  â As of the time of writing, no pricing information has been announced, but Threshold will keep you informed as announcements come out about this exciting new entrant into the home cockpit space! </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released a new set of backcountry airstrips: Cabin Creek, Wilson Bar, and Marble Creek, all in Idaho. The ânot so deadlyâ name alludes to the previously released - and much deadlier - Deadly 3.Â   Cabin CreekÂ is in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, with an airstrip surface susceptible to water and prop wash erosion. Measures were taken to minimize water erosion, such as installing water bars, but it hasnât mitigated the erosive effect of prop wash. Itâs a 1,750-foot-long dirt strip, requiring proficiency in mountain flying due to the challenging nature of the surroundings.  Wilson BarÂ is a simple turf strip with 1,500ft of total length. It is very close to the MacKay Bar airstrip and their campground.  Marble CreekÂ has a 1,160-foot-long bumpy strip, with soft sandy soil for the first 400 feet on runway 4, followed by large bumps that reduce braking effectiveness. A hill on the south end of the runway will make it hard to land on 04, and runway 22 is over a large hill. Itâs short, challenging, and surrounded by tricky terrain.  Developed by Milo Taylor, who also made the Deadly 3 and McCall Municipal Airport, the pack features three landing spots with varying degrees of difficulty, with an extensive vegetation library, new animated animals and birds, new effects, and more.  The scenery is available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $12.77, requiring at least 1 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. A new F-104 Star Fighter is coming to X-Plane 12 Brought to you by Colimata! The Starfighter, developed by Lockheed, is a supersonic air superiority fighter designed to quickly claim control of enemy airspace. This required it to be super maneuverable and fast. The unique characteristics of its stubby wings, T-tail empennage, and dartish shape make it unmistakable from anything else. Later, it was developed into an all-role, multi-weather aircraft during the 60s, giving it more versatility. Over two thousand airframe variants were built, with the final retirement by the Italian Air Force in 2004, after serving for over fifteen air forces. The Starfighter was fast, designed with the GE J79 turbojet giving performance up to Mach 1.7, even increasing to Mach 2 for later variants. Max thrust produced 15,880 pounds in full burner and 10,000 at military power. The fuel system is supported by tip tanks, internal tanks, and pylons, totaling up to 12,260 lbs. Colimata shared previews of the upcoming aircraft via screenshots in this forum post. These images show off the loadmaster configuration interface, allowing you to load weapons from rockets to missiles and drop tanks to various hard points on the 104's airframe. The Star Fighter will have a custom radar supporting air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. These modes offer multiple levels of complexity based on the user's skill and avionics knowledge. C functions aid with targeting hostile aircraft and armaments. Citing Colimatas post, The package will include three variants, with each unique cockpits. These models range from the G variant, S, and the 21c with the most modern cockpit. Colimanta states that all variants will come with a "versatile" nav system that will work with X-Plane flight plans. Quoting Colimatas targeting system statement. â Further posts covered updates of external modeling. Colimata emphasizes details of the 3d model, such as animated systems and livery textures amounting to 4k high-resolution textures. Minor important details like the thousands of rivets, panel details, and decals across the airframe are accurately reproduced based on the real-world counterpart. Â  â â As for liveries, several will ship with the package, according to Colimata; of course, The famous, polished livery will be included. Colimata will also provide paint kits for the community's creative means of creating the numerous liveries associated with the Star Fighter. Progress is moving along strongly by their indication via their x-plane.org post with the aircraft variants in beta under shakedown testing.Â  A prospective release date has been announced for the F-104 FXP during the beginning of December.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has just launched the sixth edition of their FlightSim Community Survey, asking the community to answer questions ranging from their preferred flight simulation platform and add-ons to the hardware they use and why they simulate, providing a complete understanding of the modern flight sim demographic.Â   Averaging more than 20,000 respondents since the 2020 edition, the Survey has become the go-to reference for hardware metrics, given it differs massively compared to mainstream reference data such as the Steam Hardware Survey, which takes their entire user base into account. Focusing exclusively on flight simmers, it provides a more accurate image of the most popular hardware among virtual pilots.Â   It also sheds light on the most popular flight sim platform, intent (whether simulating just for fun or training for a pilotâs license), simulation proficiency, and how many of us are real-life pilots.Â   The Survey will run for ten days from today (November 17), and the results will be published on their website in December 2023. It is entirely GDPR compliant and fully anonymous, with no personally identifiable data being collected and no redirects.Â   ClickÂ hereÂ to participate in the worldâs most comprehensive flight simulation survey!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios has recently released their rendition of Palmerston North Airport (NZPM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Palmerston North and the Central North Island (ManawatÅ«-Whanganui) region with a yearly average of 652,000 passengers.  It was built in 1931 by the Milson Aerodrome Society, originally consisting of a grass runway made exclusively for private flights. Commercial operation started five years later with Union Airways. â After a brief period of being utilized as a military facility during World War 2, it was embraced by National Airways Corporation for scheduled service, leading to the construction of a proper runway and a terminal building.Â   The 1990s brought a new terminal and taxiway, with Freedom Air launching regular international flights to Brisbane and Sydney right after the work was done.  Air New Zealand (Auckland, Christchurch) and Originair (Hamilton, Nelson, and Wellington) currently serve it.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail imagery, custom ground poly, a detailed terminal interior, PBR models, 4K textures, an up-to-date ground layout, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $12.40, requiring at least 4.43 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flight Replicas has recently made their Spitfire available on the Marketplace store. The project was first announced in March 2022 and was submitted to the Marketplace on November 16th. Flight Replicas is a developer that has previously created several war legends for Prepar3D, such as the BF-109 and the B-24 Liberator, along with the Curtiss P40 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Their earliest project dates back to 2002, which was the Messerschmitt Me-262. The Spitfire is a legendary British fighter aircraft crucial in World War II. Flight Replicas has chosen to focus on the Mk.la/Mk.IIa variant of the airframe for this recreation. The Spitfire was designed by Reginald Mitchell in the early 1930s, with its first flight taking place in March 1936, powered by the Rolls Royce Merlin III engine. The Spitfire, an iconic aircraft, is renowned for its unmistakable design silhouette that features low-drag elliptical wings. It was equipped with new design and airframe construction techniques, such as its semi-monocoque construction and aluminum alloys, making it a highly efficient interceptor. The aircraft gained altitude rapidly, earning its well-known history as a hero of the Battle of Britain. Flight Replicas has created a model of the Spitfire based on actual factory drawings and schematics.   The model has full PBR textures, a fully modeled cockpit with custom sounds, and various animations for doors, canopies, and other operational functions. Accurate liveries based on the specific variants and models during the aircraftâs development period are included. This model depicts the conversion of use to 100 octane fuel, which increased performance over 87 octane. You can purchase the Flight Replicas Spitfire model on the Marketplace for $19.49. Flight Replicas has also published the manual for the aircraft on their website free of charge. Please visit their Facebook page or website to learn more about the Flight Replicas Spitfire. You can download the manual by following this link. As always stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates!</summary>
