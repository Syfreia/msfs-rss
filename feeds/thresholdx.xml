    <title>No Money Mondays: Hong Kong Kai Tak MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/632842b3cd6b9928a6e4d323_UZ6LrSF.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="2255990"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Although it's been 24 years since the last time an airplane landed on the infamous runway 13,Kai Tak is still widely adored by flight enthusiasts all around the globe. Like the closure of Meigs Field, it marked the end of an era. Itâs impossible to talk about challenging approaches without mentioning the tricky checkerboard arrival, where a pilot had to fly low, slow, and close to apartment buildings. Pilots were also required to perform a flawless turn towards the runway, managing vertical speed and aiming for the runway threshold; simultaneously. Historically, KaiÂ Tak's runway 13 was one of the most challenging approaches in aviation. One of the most enjoyable perks of flight simulation is the ability to bring once existing airports back virtually, providing the opportunity to experience the thrill of landing in Hong Kong as it was in the 1990s. What if I told you you could experience Kai Tak for no charge in Microsoft Flight Simulator? Scenery developer ali501 shared his rendition on flights.to so that we can all go back in time to simpler days when Avgas and Jet-A guzzling airplanes were not much of a concern. An era long left behind, now to be revived in all its glory. With a fully modeled terminal, era-accurate static vehicles, and advertisements, itâs quite a throwback. ali501's Kai Tak is the perfect blend of No Money Mondays and throwback Tuesdays! Itâs hard not to feel transported back to 1998 when you spot things like the Flight Simulator 98 advertisement or the Motorola flip phone that screams late 90s nostalgia. A trip down memory lane for older folks; and a glimpse into the past for younger people. Ready to take on the Kai Tak challenge? Download it here; at least 2.04 GB of free disk space is recommended to install the product. Installation is as simple as it could possibly be: drag the ali501-kaitak folder into your MSFS Community folder, and that's it! Stay tuned to Threshold for more freeware recommendations. â</summary>

Newly released from the same team behind the aforementioned site, comes X-Plane.to. Browsing either of these sites will give you access to great freeware sceneries, liveries, etc. X-Plane.to will grow with time and community support, as time passes, it is certain that more freeware add-ons for X-Plane 12 will surface. But for now, you can expect a very similar layout as X-Plane.toâs predecessor. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. â â Optimization efforts are well underway from IniScene and their Microsoft Flight Simulator payware scenery, San Antonio (KSAT). The developerâs update, posted on both the Discord server and the IniBuilds forum mentions that they have dissolved photogrammetry in the immediate area surrounding the airport and that in and of itself has provided âmore than substantial increase in optimization,â according to the developer. Since the release of the scenery, some users have experienced stuttering issues, but the developer is hopeful that this update (releasing sometime this week-according to IniScene) will remediate any stuttering issues for users. â â Along with optimizing the scenery, IniScene has also modeled much more of the surrounding architecture in the vicinity. â â If youâre interested in picking up the KSAT scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator you can buy it directly from the Ini store, here or you can buy it from Simmarket. â</summary>

Not much has been updated on the aircraft overall though the plane now works with the SimBrief flight plan downloader. It must also be mentioned that this aircraft is now in Beta for X-Plane 12. The lack of any exciting new features in this Beta update and any news for the A350âs future is expected after the recent updates of the 767 and 757. Unfortunately there is still no news on their 787 that is still in the works but keep your eyes peeled for possible sneak peaks in the future. Currently, the A350 beta can be obtained from the X-Updater for current owners of the A350. Make sure to check the BETA box to allow the aircraft to work in X-Plane 12. If you have not yet bought this A350 you can find it on the X-Plane Store. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has just released a new hotfix to their recent A320 update, addressing issues with the rudders and landing behavior (it was prone to bouncing even with smooth touchdowns, introduced with the first hotfix that addressed the drag coefficient of the flaps). The update is available on their website for registered customers. â â A320 v1.0.3.134 [SYSTEM] Â - Adjusted custom low speed friction model to be slightly more fluidÂ  - Fixed incorrect air/ground mix factor causing irrecoverable nose down elevator after a bounced landingÂ  - Removed alpha-buffer pseudo-prot, causing issues with flare authority in certain conditions [FM]Â  - Adjusted spoiler efficacyÂ  - Improved suspension geometry and setup to reduce bouncing, absorbing more energy on touchdown and subsequently sitting lower on the groundÂ  - Added lift dumping to spoilers so the aircraft is more stable after touchdown in a crosswindÂ  - Improved aircraft's crosswind and weathervaning characteristics Â - Adjusted lateral tyre friction to prevent weight on wheels sideslip and/or unintended ice skating â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
