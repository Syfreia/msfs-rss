    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cockspur has recently published a new video on Facebook and Discord, showcasing what appears to be an almost finished Embraer Phenom 100. Cockspur is renowned for its Cessna Mustang and its latest Cessna 162. The one-and-a-half-minute video provides a quick look at the intricate details that Cockspur is known forâthe avionics in the video feature the GARMIN 1000, similar to those present in the real aircraft. The video also showcases the exterior details, which look intricate based on the close-up shots. The cabin is fully modeled, as expected. Although the developer has yet to release much information regarding specific features, we can expect to receive more details on this project soon. The Embraer Phenom 100 is a part of the Phenom corporate jet brand, manufactured by Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer. The Phenom 100, the smallest model in the range, is classified as a VLJ (Very Light Jet), with the larger model being the 300E. Phenom 100's first flight took place on July 26, 2008, and since then, it has brought Embraer immense success with the Phenom brand. A new configuration of the Phenom will cost you around $3 million. With over 400 built, it is one of the most popular light jets in the market. The Phenom is powered by two Prat and Whitney turbofan engines, producing 1,750lbs of thrust each. This engine configuration gives the Phenom 100 the ability to cruise at 400 knots with a maximum altitude of 14,100 feet with a range of about 1,300 NM. The Phenom has a single pilot rating thanks to many of its automated features. With its Prodigy Touch flight deck and Garmin 1000, these systems are highly streamlined to reduce pilot workload. The Phenom's BMW-designed cabin can comfortably carry up to five passengers. To see more, check out the video of the Phenom by Cockspur here. â As always, stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates!</summary>

The teaser image, which only shows a small part of the underbelly section, and appears to be the left main landing gear.  â From this single image, iFly hopes to show that the final product will have quite a bit of visual detail. You can see the detail that they have gone to model the gear cables, strut, and little details like the roughness of the rubber tyres. iFly also says that this preview image was taken months ago, and much progress has been made since then.  iFly is mainly known for their 737 product line for Lockheed Martinâs Prepar3D, most recently being their rendition of the Boeing 737 MAX for Prepar3D V5. In a post on their Facebook page, iFly commented about the system depth of their upcoming airliner, saying, âWhile MSFS is amazing, for raw simulation of true aircraft systems, we believe P3Dv5 allows for the highest level of system simulations using raw C++. P3Dv5 may not have the eye candy of MSFS, but for true immersion, CAT III approaches, and more, we believe the iFly MAX on Prepar3D v5 can barely be beat.â They also added that the project is âstill some time away as it is a major new development,â and that for a Microsoft Flight Simulator product, âtime-to-market for a study-level-simulator takes longer compared with the FSX/P3D lineage.â While we do not know much about this new entrant into the MSFS airliner market, Threshold will keep you informed whenever we get new information, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Microsoft has released their latest Sim Update for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing with it many bug fixes, changes, and new features to the simulator. â The major new features in this update include new Assistance features with their new Flight Plan Assistance setting, as well as fixes to the Air Traffic Control systems, improving instruction logic and phraseology. Sim Update 14 also adds a new aircraft, the Cirrus SR22 G6, complete with avionics made in partnership with Working Title. However, this upgraded Cirrus is only available to customers who have purchased the Premium Deluxe upgrade for the sim.  â Another significant change is the removal of the iniBuilds A320neo from the update. Initially promised to be slated for this update by Jorg Neumann, Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator in their September Dev Livestream, and included in the SU14 Beta, it is now absent. According to the Sim Update 14 patch notes, Microsoft explains that the reason behind the delay was that during testing they âencountered an application crash rate on console that is too high to pass certification.â Recently, the iniBuilds A320neo has come under fire from accusations that it stole code from the popular open-source A320neo made by FlyByWire, thus allegedly violating the General Public License. This change has left some users speculating whether the accusations of stolen code were the actual reason behind the delay.  â Also included in Sim Update 14 are the changes to the atmosphere and lighting in the sim, as mentioned in Microsoftâs November Dev Livestream. These highly requested changes fix sky colors and make the atmosphere and horizon look more realistic. There have also been fixes to the snow coverage and icing systems and other changes to live weather. As with all of the Sim Updates, there are a whole host of small tweaks and squashed bugs that are too many to list here, but you can find the full patch notes on Microsoftâs website here. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Secret Studio has recently released their rendition of Sultan Mahmud Kuala Terengganu International Airport (WMKN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Kuala Terengganu in Malaysia with a yearly average of 919,829 passengers. â It was established in the 1920s as a small airfield, used primarily for military purposes during World War II. It served as a base for the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Japanese Imperial Army.â  After the war, the British colonial authorities expanded and upgraded the airport to accommodate civilian air travel. It was renamed Sultan Mahmud Airport in honor of Sultan Mahmud Al-Muktafi Billah Shah, the 16th Sultan of Terengganu.  In the following years, Sultan Mahmud Airport became an important transportation hub for the Terengganu region, connecting it with other parts of Malaysia and neighboring countries. The airport underwent several upgrades and modernizations to keep pace with the region's air travel growth.  In 2008, a major renovation and expansion project was undertaken to upgrade the airport's facilities and increase its capacity. The project included constructing a new terminal building, a new runway, and other airport infrastructure improvements.  Today, Sultan Mahmud Airport is one of the busiest airports in Malaysia, serving as a vital economic driver for the Terengganu region, supporting tourism, trade, and other industries. The airport continues to evolve and expand to meet the growing demand for air travel in Malaysia and the surrounding regions.  It's served by four airlines: AirAsia (Kuala Lumpur-International), Batik Air Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur-Subang), Firefly (Kuala Lumpur-Subang), and Malaysia Airlines (Kuala Lumpur-International).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality custom buildings, PBR textures, an in-house VDGS system, custom ILS, custom animated jetways, custom terraforming, a detailed terminal interior, and custom ground traffic.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $12.97 and requires at least 888.37 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimWorks Studios has recently released their rendition of the Pilatus PC-12 Legacy for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a single-engined turboprop aircraft first flown in the early 1990s and popular among corporate transport companies, government agencies, and air-ambulance operators.  Its development was announced in October 1989 at the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), and it had been under development for a few years prior under high levels of secrecy (they had commenced the prototype assembly by the time it was announced). It was believed to be the first single-engined aircraft capable of flying at high speed across long distances, a market that was unheard of back then. The prototype was completed in May 1991, and the first flight took off only 30 days later.Â   While the original plans were for a mid-1991 certification, a wing redesign delayed progress by a few years, with the certification only being issued in March 1994 (Europe) and July 1994 (United States).  It has undergone multiple improvements over its production span, with more powerful engines, new avionics, noise reduction measures, new propellers, increased speed and range, and more. It was also modified by other aviation firms that added their enhancement packages.  The variant at hand was certified in 2005, and it's powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-67B engine, with a range of 1742 miles, a maximum take-off weight of 4,740 kg, and a cruise speed of 500 km/h.Â   The add-on features an accurate simulation of the PC-12, developed with help from Pilatus Aircraft and Fly7 Executive Aviation, replicating the real aircraft's handling behavior with correct propeller beta and reverse operation, custom ITT simulation, and realistic flap deployment timings. It also includes various custom systems, ranging from a custom aileron-rudder interconnect system to usable circuit breakers, PMS GTN, TDS GTNXi, and Sky4Sim Tablet compatibility. The complete list of features follows below:   It's available onÂ their storeÂ andÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $26.98, requiring at least 3.95 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly X Simulations has recently released their rendition of Kuusamo Airport (EFKS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the northeastern part of the Northern Ostrobothnia in Finland with a yearly average of 87,000 passengers.  It was inaugurated in 1972, with a regular scheduled route between Oulu and Kuusamo starting that same year. The original runway length was around 800 meters, which was expanded for the first time in 1974 to 1,500 meters so that larger aircraft could visit it.   In the late 1980s, the passenger terminal was inaugurated, and the runway was extended to 2,000 meters so they could get jet traffic.  The late 1990s brought the final runway extension (to 2,500 meters), and the passenger terminal was expanded for the first time.Â   In the early 2000s, the airport was granted its international status and underwent a renovation and expansion of its terminal building.  Itâs served by Finnair with a daily route to Helsinki and visited by Lufthansa, Jet2, TUI Airways, and TUI fly Netherlands on a seasonal basis.\  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings (including wear and tear), high-resolution PBR textures, accurate airport buildings, and a detailed airside terminal interior.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $11.32, requiring at least 409 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>
