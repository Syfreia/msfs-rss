    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published another Fokker F28Â development updateÂ concerning its current state. In relation to last monthâs update, they have implemented fully animated passenger and cargo doors, wheel chocks, and cones around the airplane. They also state the visual work is pretty much complete at this point.  They have also begun working on the F28 systems, which are unique to the aircraft, increasing the complexity and requiring close collaboration with their testing team of ex-F28 specialists (pilots, engineers, training crew) to ensure maximum fidelity. âYou certainly wonât be mistaking this aircraft for your typical airliner!â says the developer.  The aircraft is now in a flyable state, with all animations, cockpit instrumentation, annunciators, and basic systems. It is now undergoing testing by their team. â  Credits to DragonRuins for the news scoop. Stay tuned to Threshold for further updates on the F28 development and more! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The yearly Navigraph Survey has been released to the FlightSim community where a selection of questions will be asked based on Partnerships, Demographics, Relation to any real life aviation and much more! â The survey period lasts from today, the 18th November 2022 to the 28th November. It is a 10 day window where flight sim enthusiasts have their opinion on what they want to see in future development. â Take part in the Navigraph FlightSim Community Survey 2022 by clicking here The questions asked in the survey will be straightforward and will give you an option whether it is optional or not. You have to be honest in the survey as this is the best way developers can get an idea of what people want to see in the future. Questions can range from age, overall income and education levels to what intrigues you about FlightSim and why you spend the hours you do being part of a massive aviation community. â The 2022 survey is one of the largest surveyâs of its kind and contains a much more broad selection of simulators as well as newly arose aircraft developers. As we all know Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 has seen a massive amount of development since it was released 2 years ago by developers such as PMDG, Fenix Simulations, FlyByWire, Orbx, Aerosoft, UK2000 and much much more. A few months ago Laminar Research had released the Early Access / Beta version of X-Plane 12 which the team at Laminar have been working incredibly hard on to provide constant Beta updates for the users of X-Plane. Again this newly released simulator has seen a massive amount of development from external developers such as X-Works, Threshold, Toliss, FlightFactor, Orbx and many more. This year should give some interesting results due to the recent development on these newly released simulators. Here is a link to last years results where we saw MSFS take the lead, who will take the lead this year? Let us know below. â Unfortunately, Threshold are not shown in the partnerships in this yearâs survey. Results will be announced on Navigraphâs blog in Mid-December, the survey is anonymous and no personally identifiable information is collected, and the results will only be presented in aggregated form. â Again, to take part in the Navigraph 2022 Survey click here! â We look forward to seeing the results!</summary>

    <title>PMDG Releases SU11 Compatibility Update for 737 Lineup</title>
    <updated>2022-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/prscu7" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/63781b919fa94377345ae198_11%20(1).png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="833628"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has just released a new update to the 737 lineup, ensuring compatibility with Sim Update 11 and its new standards, built on the latest SDK. According to Robert RandazzoâsÂ forum announcement, the main focus has been the tuning of the control law for the automatic flight control system in pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust, mitigating an issue with the previous update related to the atmospheric stability simulation that is claimed to be âsignificantly unrealisticâ and requiring the creation of additional logic into the control law. PMDG also claims the 737 control logic improvements will pave the way towards greater realism in atmospheric stability without need for changes.Â   They have been working on bringing forward new features that are now possible with SU11, such as a weather radar, but the results are not yet up to the expected standard, thus still under development. A short list of other minor fixes follows down below: 0012072: [General - Documentation] Amend Introduction document to remove Wifi Antenna FWD/AFT option (hvanrensburg) 0012051: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Capt Stab trim clipping (vscimone) 0012052: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] MIssing pixel on Electrical Panel when using New pressurization panel option (vscimone) 0011821: [External Model - Geometry] Negative pressure relief valve text &amp; push panel mis-aligned (jbrown) 0011614: [External Model - Geometry] Paintkit Model Texture Distortion (jbrown) Work on the SU11 transition has delayed the progress on the 737-900, which they hope should be entering testing by next week. The EFB, on the other hand, is apparently well into testing and progressing well. Randazzo has mentioned that a preview will probably happen as soon as they feel itâs ready to be shown.  Regarding the marketplace addition, they claim it was submitted today to Asobo for approval, and it should become available soon.Â   The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Images are courtesy of Pineapple_Wizard.

AsÂ previously stated,Â the integration took a while because they had to develop a âbridgeâ to interact with the sandboxed environment of Microsoft Flight Simulator, allowing it to communicate with external applications. According to their statement, the âbreakoutâ will also pave the way for future expansions and a return to normal development pace.Â  The Maddog is available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $77.81, requiring at least 298 MB of free disk space to install.Â  Credits to Saffa-Jake on Discord for the scoop, and the images are courtesy of thoar.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Lamezia Terme International Airport (LICA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the principal airport of Calabria, with a yearly average of 3 million passengers. Regularly visited by ITA, Ryanair, Edelweiss, easyJet, and WizzAir, the traffic peaks during the summer, where other airlines also fly down to Calabria, such as Air Transat, Austrian, Condor, Eurowings, Finnair, Smartwings and Transavia.Â   The airport opened in June 1976, with the first modernization and expansion happening in 1982. Recently, the runway was extended from the original 2,414 meters to 3,017 meters. In 2008, Engco won a competition to design a newÂ passenger terminal, aiming to expand the limited capacity of the old one, which grew unable to handle such volume. The idea was to build the new one while progressively demolishing the old terminal, keeping both functioning simultaneously until the progress was finally complete. Due to lack of funding, the plans never came to fruition.Â   The scenery features a detailed representation of the entire airport area, with an up-to-date layout (as of October 2022) featuring the new extended apron and the runway extension, custom static aircraft (an AB 412 and a Canadair CL-415 that operate at the airport), projected mesh groundpoly, custom GSE and clutter, an animated radar, and custom taxi signs and approach lighting.Â   Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $16.49, requiring at least 2.79 GB of free disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TropicalSim has recently released their rendition of Trieste Airport, also known as Aeroporto Friuli-Venezia Giulia (LIPQ), for Microsoft Flight Simulator. With nearly 800.000 passengers a year, TRS serves the city of Trieste in Italy and its surroundings, with a catchment area nearing 5 million people due to the proximity to the border with Slovenia, Austria, and Croatia.Â   Itâs frequently visited by Ryanair with 8 destinations (Bari, Cagliari, Catania, London Stansted, Malta, Naples, Palermo, and Valencia), with three more to come shortly (Barcelona, Charleroi, Â and Dublin). Lufthansa also flies to Trieste from Frankfurt and ITA Airways from Rome.Â   The founding of Trieste Airport is unknown, but the first mention of it dates back to November 1935, when it housed a wing of the Royal Italian Air Force. Commercial operations took off in December 1961.Â   The scenery features a high-detail rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with native MSFS night lighting, animated jetways, seamless integration with the default Bing imagery, usage of SDK materials and native gITF models, and PBR textures.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.12, requiring at least 770 MB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
