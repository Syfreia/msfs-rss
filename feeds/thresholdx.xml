    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After having developed the A310 for MSFS, iniBuilds announces the continuation of its partnership with MSFS with two new aircraft under development: The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny and the Grumman G-21A Goose. Both aircraft will be 100% free and developed exclusively for MSFS. In a forum post, the CEO of iniBuilds is pleased to announce the continuation of their partnership with MSFS with these two historic aircraft under development. The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny, was a military training aircraft with production starting in 1915. After the end of the First World War, there was a surplus of aircraft that became civilian aircraft in 1918. From then on, the JN-4 became a very popular trainer for solo training flights, for the civilian market. It is therefore a historic aircraft full of adventure and history that iniBuilds is developing for a modern simulator, more than 100 years after the real-life Curtiss JN-4 Jenny was released. The second aircraft under development, the Grumman G-21A Goose, has a different story. Originally, it was a group of Long Islanders who wanted a business aircraft to fly to and from New York. So they approached Grumman. Following discussions, Grumman converted the Grumman Goose and that's how the G-21A was born, in around 1936. The G-21A was later upgraded to carry 8 passengers and fly military missions all over the world. iniBuilds has endeavoured to reproduce this atmosphere in the aircraft cabin with a bar, champagne bucket and restroom facilities to remain true to the model.Â  The first pictures of the cockpit show the progress the developers have made on this aircraft, which already makes us want to fly it!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, developer Just Flight published a short blog on the key differences between its upcoming RJ Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator and the 146 Professional for MSFS that was released almost a year ago. Through the post, Just Flight briefly introduced the most noticeable, as well as the more hidden, differences in exterior modeling and cockpit layout of the two products. Starting with the exterior, the developer pointed out that RJ Professional will feature different probe configuration, more powerful engine options, and as many as 29 new liveraries. Moving on to the cockpit, the most significant upgrades to the aircrafts can be seen. Most of the analog instruments from the HDI to the engine indicators are placed with a new suite of electronic flight instrumentation systems. The new system will also include a brand new primary flight instrument system, and navigational display. Furthermore, the cockpit will feature a digital metric altimeter, full authority digital engine control system, and a âmore capable digital flight guidance system (FGS) is controlled by the mode control panel (MCP)â Finally, the RJ Professional will be equipped with two custom-coded GNLU-910 FMSs and a new automatic pressurization system in the overhead panel. In addition to the upgrades described above, a series of more subtle changes from a reworked radio panel and yoke checklists are also added to the aircraft. A full list of changes can be checked out on Just Flightâs website. Currently, Just Flight is yet to announce a release date and pricing for the RJ Professional for MSFS. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The team behind the popular X-Plane addon xEnviro have released an update on what's in store regarding the project's future development.Â  âIn a forum post this evening, head of development Magnus has outlined future plans for the project along with reasons behind the perhaps seemingly slow development of version 1.17 â It has been revealed that xEnviro will not be released during the Beta phase of X-Plane 12. Magnus provides us with the reasoning behind this;Â  âxEnviro will not be released in this Beta run.Â Laminar Research has closed off all access to the platform by not giving access to the 3D draw callback, depth buffer and so on. X-Plane 11 was already limiting us and thus demanded a lot on performance to work. Especially when Vulkan was released, and our dynamic seasons got abruptly cut off. âÂ  Magnus goes on to further state; âHowever. We are in a dialogue with Austin on the matter, and I am optimistic that we will find a solution to our limited access so that we can release 1.18 in XP12.
