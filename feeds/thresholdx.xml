    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Got Friends has recently released their rendition of the Revolution Mini-500 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a single-seat light helicopter from the 90s sold as a kit for homebuilding by Revolution Helicopter Corporation.Â   Designed to resemble a mini Hughes 500, the Mini-500 is powered by a Rotax 582 engine that produces around 64 horsepower, with a range of 225 miles and a maximum speed of 115 mph. The fuselage is made of tubular steel with a cabin made of foam and structured with glass fiber.Â   It first flew in 1992, with its official introduction in 1994, and a total of 500 kits sold until production ceased about six years later. The kits were sold for around $24,500, including the engine, the fiberglass enclosure, instruments (the basic pack), the electric starter, landing lights, and navigation lights. As most of the parts came pre-assembled at the factory, the total build time was around 40 hours.Â   The MSFS counterpart features custom MGL avionics, multiple visual effects (including downwash, combustion, heat, rain, and icing), a native flight model using the Helicopter SDK, interchangeable avionics (GTR-220 radio or GNS-530), and many custom liveries.  Itâs available on theÂ Got Friends ShopÂ for $15.00.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Kochi Ryoma Airport (RJOK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Nankoku in Kochi Prefecture. Itâs the 21st busiest airport in Japan, averaging 1.6 million passengers a year (pre-pandemic). Built on 120 hectares of land, the airport features a single (2,500-meter-long) runway, handling small to medium size aircraft. It has a single terminal building, handling domestic flights, with a few international charters. The terminal features various shops and restaurants and an observation deck on the third floor. The airport is known for its stunning natural surroundings, with views of the nearby mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Overall, KÅchi Airport provides convenient access to the beautiful region of KÅchi and its many attractions. The airport dates back to 1944 when it was built for the Royal Japanese Navy. After WW2, the US forces took charge of the airfield for eight years, when it was then converted into a civilian airport, with operations to start two years later.  The scenery features a detailed rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with custom photorealistic terrain, custom jetways, realistic ground markings, and night lighting. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $13.89, requiring at least 106 MB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Tampa International Airport (KTPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Tampa Bay Area in Florida with more than 93 non-stop destinations throughout the globe.  Tampa is known as the birthplace of commercial airline service, when a Benoist Flying Boat took off from St. Petersburg (Florida) to Tampa Airboat Line in early 1914, consecrating itself as the first scheduled commercial flight in the world. It was a 23-mile-long flight, and the service ran for about five months. The airport itself dates back to 1928, then called Drew Field. It was heavily used during WW2 for training, where it underwent modernization and expansion.Â   Post-war, it went back to its original role of being just an airport, with its first international flights to begin a couple of years later, in 1950. A new terminal reached completion not long after, in 1952. A decade later, with the popularity of jet aircraft and many new airlines flying to Tampa, expansion became a priority, with the authorities planning a replacement terminal in an undeveloped site at the airport, whose production kicked off in 1968 and completion came three years later, increasing the capacity and consolidating Tampa as an important domestic and international destination.Â   The airport collects several quality awards, including Best Overall U.S. Airport in 2007 and 2008 by Zagat Survey, Second Best Airport in the World by CondÃ© Nas in 2008, and 6th place on CNNâsÂ Ten of the Worldâs Most Loved Airports, and itâs considered by Airports Council International as the best airport in America for its size (2020).  With an average of 20 million passengers yearly, Tampa is served by most major domestic airlines, including Southwest (27.81% of the market share), Delta Air Lines (17.52% of the market share), American Airlines (16.89% of the market share), United Airlines (10.69% of the market share), and Spirit Airlines (10.03% of the market share). The top domestic destinations list includes Atlanta (925,000 passengers), Chicago-OâHare (463,000), and Charlotte (450,000).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with an updated taxiway layout, animated passengers with âhalf-interiorâ airside and terminals, proper AI routing and vehicle pathing, realistic airline codes, custom taxi signs, custom airport lighting, a blend of custom and photorealistic imagery, animated HVAC fans, flags, and trams, handcrafted mesh with taxiway bridges, high-resolution color-graded imagery, surrounding area landmarks (Raymond James, International Plaza, Grand Hyatt, etc.).  Itâs available on Verticalsimâs Shop for $21.99, requiring at least 4.12 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds hasÂ recently announcedÂ the development of Oklahoma City Airport (KOKC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest commercial airport in Oklahoma with a yearly average of 4 million passengers.  Oklahoma City Airport, or Will Rogers World Airport, first opened in 1911 as Oklahoma City Municipal Airfield renamed 30 years later after Will Rogers. It served as a major training facility during WW2, with over fifteen air force groups stationed there over the course of the war. Post-war saw commercial activity in the late fifties, with over 48 daily commercial flights from different airlines.Â  â In the late 90s, expansion talks ensued from the old age of the original terminal, dating back to 1967. Plans launched not much later, in 2001, with the demolition of the twin concourses to make room for the new project: a larger terminal with high ceilings and modern facilities. One hundred and ten million dollars, and five years later, the project finally reached completion, with the third phase still pending.  The aforementioned third phase only happened in March 2019, finishing roughly two years later, substantially increasing the passenger handling capacity and the overall quality of the facilities.  iniBuildsâ rendition will feature an accurate rendition of the airport as it stands, with a fully modeled interior, up-to-date airport and terminal layout, HD textures, 3D people, detailed jetways, correct airline parking allocations, fully modeled landside, and custom taxi signs.Â   Thereâs no information regarding pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Rfscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Brussels South Charleroi Airport (EBCI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, also referred to as Brussels-Charleroi Airport. It is the second busiest airport in Belgium, with a yearly average of 8 million passengers (pre-pandemic).  Charleroi is a popular low-cost alternative to Brussels Airport (EBBR), being an important hub for Ryanair, WizzAir, and TUI fly Belgium, both offering an extensive intra-European network. Itâs also home to Air Belgium, a scheduled and charter airline founded six years ago offering many holiday destinations, including Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mauritius, and South Africa. The history of Brussels-Charleroi dates back to 1919 when it used to be a flying school, with maintenance activities to start a year later. To this day, itâs still a busy general aviation airfield with three flying schools.  The airportâs traffic grew in the late 1990s when Ryanair embraced Charleroi for the first time (it went on to become one of their continental bases). Other low-cost carriers like WizzAir soon joined the trend, increasing the traffic figures and justifying the construction of a new terminal, which opened in early 2008 with a capacity for up to 5 million passengers a year. It wasnât long until it reached that limit, which led to the creation of a second terminal in 2017, accommodating up to 10 million passengers a year.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it stands, with custom buildings around the area, custom vehicles, custom objects and clutter, navigation infrastructure, and custom lighting. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $19.26, requiring at least 680 MB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

Bigger, substantially more modern, and with better accessibility, the new airport went on to become the busiest airport in Scandinavia.  Sporting over 200 destinations (domestic and international), OSL is a hub for Norse Atlantic Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, and Wideroe. The visitors' list includes most major european airlines, such as Air France, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia, KLM, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Swiss, TAP Air Portugal, Turkish, and WizzAir. Trondheim (2,092,000), Bergen (1,987,000), and Stavanger (1,603,000) are among the top three busiest destinations from Gardermoen, further reinforcing the strength of domestic operations in the airport.  The scenery features detailed modeling and texturing of the terminal and surrounding buildings and hangars, with PBR texturing in 4K, interior modeling, three different types of animated jetways to match the real world, fully functioning VDGS for all appropriate gates, animated traffic, custom ground service equipment, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $20.62, requiring at least 6.34 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Lognes-Ãmerainville aerodrome (LFPL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the community of Lognes in the suburbs of Paris (roughly 28 km east of it).  Opened to public air traffic in 1947, itâs the biggest private light aircraft aerodrome in the country, with the unusuality of being open to international traffic, unlike many other french airfields. The fact it sits close to five other aerodromes makes it extremely handy for flight schools, increasing its traffic figures. Lognes is open to light aviation under VFR, handling up to 80,568 aircraft movements back in 2014, ranking it within the top 10 in France (movement-wise).  With a 700-meter-long paved runway and a 1,100-meter-long grass runway, the airfield is ideal for small general aviation aircraft, especially trainers such as the 152, 172, etc. As a curiosity, Lognes hosts AGILE, an association created in 1983 whose focus is the management of the 25 to 30 aircraft that belong to the clubâs members.The scenery features an accurate rendition of the aerodrome, with PBR texturing based on on-site photography, detailed modeling including the tower interior, animated humans, and custom lighting.  Itâs available for free on SimMarket, requiring at least 275 MB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FeelThere Releases Nashville International Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Nashville International Airport (KBNA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Nashville Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 18 million passengers.  Opened in June 1937, passenger service started a month later with American Airlines and Eastern Air Lines. It originally featured three runways, a three-story passenger terminal, a control tower, two hangars, and a beacon. The yearly figures hit nearly 190,000 passengers.  It was used as the headquarters for the 4th Ferrying Command during World War 2, ferrying aircraft to Europe at the height of the war. The ferrying operations demanded a lot of space, which implied an expansion to 1,500 acres of total area.Â   Nearly a decade later, the City Aviation Department made plans to modernize and expand the airport, with a new terminal, runway expansion, and a new crosswind runway to come in 1961.  As a curiosity, Nashville Intl. was the first municipal airport in the United States with a public reading room.Â   It has seen a lot of expansion work over the following years, with its peak in the late 1980s, when American Airlines made a hub in Nashville and attracted many companies to the city, such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation. The hub eventually closed in 1995, when American couldnât afford to lose any more money (it wasnât profitable even during its heyday).Â   The airport has been recently modernized, with operations starting in 2006 and reaching its conclusion five years later, expanding the ticketing and check-in areas, renovating and constructing new bathrooms, and bringing the total size of the terminal to 1 million square feet. In 2021, the operator made a plan called âNew Horizonâ to further improve the airport, at the cost of 1.5 billion USD. Construction is set to begin in 2023 and reach completion in late 2028.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with over a hundred custom-modeled buildings, taxi bridges, custom night lighting, custom jetways, and custom ground polygon.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ and onÂ FeelThereâs ShopÂ for $21.39/$19.99 (respectively), requiring at least 609 MB of free disk space to install.
