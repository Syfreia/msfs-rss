    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MtnFly Simulations have been developing a freeware Learjet-25A and have recently released a substantial progress update, outlining what has to be done, what is complete and even showcasing a full flight of the aircraft on their youtube channel.Â  Their update log outlining what has been done is as follows:Â  - NAV and COM radios are fully functional and will now work with the Garmin GPS even though there is no concept of a true standby frequency in the early model 35's radios. - The yaw damper has been modelled and is now functioning. - The three AC to DC power inverters are now modelled and functioning. - The FC-200 autopilot is now working as expected. - Improvements have been made to the side audio panels. - All four batteries are now connected to their respective power busses and functionÂ  - The captain's flight instruments are close to being fully functional. - The emergency brake lever has been modelled and now functions. - The cabin temperature indicator will now display a "cold-soaked" temperature on start-up. It will react to the user's set temperature setting once the engines are running and the passenger air conditioning system is turned on. - Improvements have been made to tying electrical circuits to their respective circuit breakers. - The RCA WXD weather radar has been modelled for those that prefer to fly "old school" without any GPS. - Panel lighting has been added. - Exterior Lighting has been added. - There have been many improvements to emissive lighting throughout the aircraft. - The wing to fuselage fairing has been added. - There have been numerous modelling updates. â At Threshold we will keep you updated while this project progresses. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Popular aircraft developer FlightFactor has recently announced a compatibility update for the beloved, highly in-depth A350 Advanced for X-Plane 12. Not much has been updated on the aircraft overall though the plane now works with the SimBrief flight plan downloader. It must also be mentioned that this aircraft is now in Beta for X-Plane 12. The lack of any exciting new features in this Beta update and any news for the A350âs future is expected after the recent updates of the 767 and 757. Unfortunately there is still no news on their 787 that is still in the works but keep your eyes peeled for possible sneak peaks in the future. Currently, the A350 beta can be obtained from the X-Updater for current owners of the A350. Make sure to check the BETA box to allow the aircraft to work in X-Plane 12. If you have not yet bought this A350 you can find it on the X-Plane Store. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Earlier this week, Flight Simulation Association published the travel details for FlightSimExpo 2023. The 3-day event is currently set to take place between June 23 - 25 in the city of Houston. Different from previous expos, FlightSImExpo 2023 will be held in two different locations. On Friday the 23rd, the event will be hosted in DoubleTree Houston Hobby where guests can participate in a reception and welcome seminars. On Saturday and Sunday, the event will move to Lone Star Flight Museum which is around a 15 minutes drive away from the hotel. Those who attend the event will receive free access to the museum for the weekend. Apart from the official events, the organizers are also working with NASA, the FAA, and other parties to arrange off-site excursions. The organizers have once again negotiated discounted prices at two hotels for attendees for FlightSimExpo. They encourage anyone who wishes to attend the event to book their hotel rooms as soon as possible in order to enjoy a special rate of $109/night at the DoubleTree and $89/night at Houston Marriott South at Hobby Airport. Guests at these two hotels will enjoy free transportation to/from Houston Hobby Airport, as well as free parking for those who are driving. Finally, the organizers have also obtained a 10% discount for those looking to purchase tickets to Houston from Delta or Southwest Airlines. More details on travel discounts can be found here. Registration for the expo will open in December; a 3-day pass can be purchased for only $50 USD. Currently, a final list of developers who will participate in the event has not been released; Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>
