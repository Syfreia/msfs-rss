    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Xometry Design has recently previewed their rendition of Catania-Fontanarossa Airport (LICC) for X-Plane 11 and 12, the busiest airport in Sicily and fourth in Italy as of 2020, with a yearly average of 10 million passengers.   Catania is a focus city for Ryanair and WizzAir, offering flights to many European destinations. It is also regularly visited by major carriers such as Air France, easyJet, KLM, Lufthansa, and Turkish, along with many other airlines on a seasonal basis.  Catania-Fontanarossa was the regionâs first airport, dating back to 1924. It was controlled by the allies during WW2 and used by the USAF as a military airfield, where it hosted the 340th Bombardment Group for a few months in 1943 and the 51st Troop Carrier Wing right after, until June 1944. Civil authorities took control not long after the end of the war. After the war, it underwent reconstruction and expansion, with commercial flights beginning to operate in the 1950s. In the following decades, the airport continued to grow in popularity and passenger traffic, becoming one of the busiest airports in Southern Italy. In recent years, there have been several modernization and expansion projects, including the construction of a new terminal, aimed at improving its facilities and capacity. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with high-quality custom buildings, high-resolution and color-corrected satellite imagery, high-resolution ground textures, SAM jetways, VDGS units, accurate ground markings, main terminal interior, custom ground clutter, and accurately placed dirt, wear, and tear. Itâs going to be compatible with X-Plane 11 and 12. Thereâs no information regarding the price or release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BlueBird Simulations has recently uploaded a video showcasing their interactive checklist feature and lighting (internal and external) for their upcoming Boeing 757 add-on.  They initially go through the before engine start checklist where you can witness a start from cold &amp; dark, followed by the IRS alignment procedure and the demonstration of the lights in the cockpit and externally. The BlueBird Simulations 757 aims to be a mid-level complexity airplane, with several degrees of extra depth over default aircraft. It says to feature highly accurate 3D visuals based on reference pictures and documents, a flight model built on real-world data, and the system complexity is yet to be confirmed, according to their website. The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was designed to replace the 727 on short and medium-length routes, first flown in 1982. It was popular with airlines due to its efficiency and range and was used primarily for transcontinental and transatlantic flights. The 757 was also known for its advanced technology, including fly-by-wire controls and a glass cockpit. Its production ended in 2004, but many are still in service today. There is currently no information on the price and release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Launceston Airport (YMLT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second-busiest airport in Tasmania after Hobart, with a yearly average of 1,500,000 passengers (pre-pandemic).  Qantas Group is the biggest operator in the airport, with their subsidiary (JetStar) offering up to six daily flights to and from Melbourne, two daily flights to and from Sydney, and one daily flight to Brisbane. Virgin Australia offers a similar selection with five daily flights to and from Melbourne, one to Sydney, and seasonal flights on select days to Brisbane. Airlines of Tasmania and Sharp Airlines offer a variety of short legs to nearby destinations. Its origins date back to the early 1930s, when it was established as a small grass runway for regional flights, then called The Western Junction Aerodrome. It was officially opened as a government aerodrome in 1931 when over 20,000 people watched Colonel Brinsmead - then controller of civil aviation - âcut the inaugural ribbon.â From 1932 and beyond, small aircraft would fly from Launceston to Flinders Island.  During WW2, it was used by the Royal Australian Air Force as a flight school, preparing pilots for combat. It was the only RAAF air base in Â Tasmania. Two of the hangars are still around to this day.  In the early 60s, plans for a Major redevelopment were approved, which included a runway extension, pavement strengthening, and a new terminal building. In 1982, the runway was once again extended to allow for the operation of Boeing 767s. The current privatization came in 1998, with joint ownership between the Launceston City Council and Australia Pacific Airports Corporation. The post-9/11 crisis and the rise of low-cost airlines made the airport grow in passenger traffic, reaching one million passengers for the first time in 2007.  Such exponential growth demanded another expansion, which doubled the size of the terminal and reached completion in November 2009, costing 20 million Australian dollars.  Developed by Ken Hall, an indie, who happens to be from the region and had exclusive access to the airport, taking hundreds of reference pictures to help with the accuracy and even allow for extra realism on the texturing side of things. It features a faithful recreation of the airport as it currently stands, with PBR texturing, static aircraft, detailed hangars, and terminal building. Itâs available on Orbx Direct for roughly $17.03, requiring at least 2.65 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDGâs Boeing 737-700 is now available on Microsoft Flight Simulator's marketplace, only on PC at this time and priced at $69.99 (pricing may vary per region).Â  â The marketplace version is almost identical to the PMDG Store counterpart, featuring three different variations: passenger, BBJ, and cargo, all with accurately represented systems, a high-fidelity flight model, PBR textures, a realistic flight deck, and different cabins matching the chosen variation, along with the ability to pick between winglets or split scimitars. The only difference between both is that the Marketplace version does not come with the Operations Center, which is obtainable from their official downloads section. Updates might also take longer, as the files need to be approved by Microsoft before being pushed to the marketplace. The Boeing 737-700 is a single-aisle, twin-engine jetliner that is part of the 737 aircraft family. It was introduced by Boeing in 1997 as a shorter and more fuel-efficient version of the 737-800, typically seating between 110 and 149 passengers (depending on the configuration), and offering up to 2,950nm of range. Commonly used by airlines for short to medium-haul flights, it's known for its reliability and cost-effectiveness. â Images are courtesy of ZachJaneway. Thereâs no information regarding the arrival of the -600 and -800 models to the marketplace yet, but Threshold will keep you updated! â â</summary>

    <title>MLD Scenery Releases Iasi International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-01-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MLD Scenery has recently released their rendition of Iasi International Airport (LRIA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth-busiest airport in Romania with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers (pre-pandemic).  As one of the oldest accredited airports in Romania, its history dates back to almost 100 years ago (1926), when it first became a commercial airport with scheduled flights, operated by CFRNA (Compagnie Franco-Roumaine de Navigation AÃ©rienne). Almost 30 years later, it got a new runway, a modern lighting system, and a passenger terminal followed in 1969, with another upgrade in 2001 to separate domestic and international flights.  A brand new terminal (T2) was built in 2012, increasing its passenger capacity and specially designated for Schengen and domestic flights. A long-term, multi-stage upgrade program started the year after, including a new runway (finished in 2014), a new terminal building (inaugurated in 2015), and an apron extension (completed in 2021).  In early 2022, the managers signed a â¬66 million contract with an Austrian construction company to design and build a new terminal (T4) and extend the parking lot, increasing the airportâs capacity to 3.3 million passengers yearly. The estimated completion date is sometime in December 2023.  The scenery features a high-fidelity rendition of the airport, with an updated layout (as of 2022), custom ground polygons, custom approach and taxi lights, custom night lighting, parallax windows, and photorealistic textures on the airport buildings. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.16, requiring at least 1.62 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSDreamTeam has recently updated GSX Pro for Microsoft Flight Simulator, adding support for remote deicing, new menu colors, and several QoL improvements.  GSX Pro improves and expands the ground services with realistic pushback, catering, refueling, baggage loading, and marshaling, introducing unique features such as visible animated passengers, cargo loading, follow me cars, towbar pushback, de-icing, underground refueling, walk-in gates, VDGS docking systems, and more.Â   The newest update adds support for remote deicing, allowing the user to call for deicing on remote pads like in real life. FSDT claims itâs just the first step of the update, with the upcoming one featuring editing of custom deicing areas.Â   The deicing fluid simulation was also improved, with different colors per fluid type (one is yellow, two is clear, three is orange, and four is green) and varying saturation depending on concentration.Â   GSXâs in-game menu was modified, featuring a new color scheme that better matches the simâs default color palette, and new icons to help differentiate between runway starts and custom deicing areas.Â  The update also added an option to ignore departure time when using SimBrief, internal support for the Aerosoft TwinOtter and PMDG DC-6, new safedock types, exclusion patterns to prevent jetways not being recognized correctly on some third-party airports using jetway links as simobjects, and more. The complete changelog follows down below:  â Itâs available onÂ FSDreamTeamâs websiteÂ for $29.99, requiring at least 8 GB of free disk space to install.
