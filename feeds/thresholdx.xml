    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flight Replicas has recently made their Spitfire available on the Marketplace store. The project was first announced in March 2022 and was submitted to the Marketplace on November 16th. Flight Replicas is a developer that has previously created several war legends for Prepar3D, such as the BF-109 and the B-24 Liberator, along with the Curtiss P40 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Their earliest project dates back to 2002, which was the Messerschmitt Me-262. The Spitfire is a legendary British fighter aircraft crucial in World War II. Flight Replicas has chosen to focus on the Mk.la/Mk.IIa variant of the airframe for this recreation. The Spitfire was designed by Reginald Mitchell in the early 1930s, with its first flight taking place in March 1936, powered by the Rolls Royce Merlin III engine. The Spitfire, an iconic aircraft, is renowned for its unmistakable design silhouette that features low-drag elliptical wings. It was equipped with new design and airframe construction techniques, such as its semi-monocoque construction and aluminum alloys, making it a highly efficient interceptor. The aircraft gained altitude rapidly, earning its well-known history as a hero of the Battle of Britain. Flight Replicas has created a model of the Spitfire based on actual factory drawings and schematics.   The model has full PBR textures, a fully modeled cockpit with custom sounds, and various animations for doors, canopies, and other operational functions. Accurate liveries based on the specific variants and models during the aircraftâs development period are included. This model depicts the conversion of use to 100 octane fuel, which increased performance over 87 octane. You can purchase the Flight Replicas Spitfire model on the Marketplace for $19.49. Flight Replicas has also published the manual for the aircraft on their website free of charge. Please visit their Facebook page or website to learn more about the Flight Replicas Spitfire. You can download the manual by following this link. As always stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published a new development update with information on the next 737 Lineup update, marketplace intake, and the upcoming 777 for Microsoft Flight Simulator.  The next update for the 737 lineup is already with their testing team for validation, including new features developed in the background and now ready, along with structural changes that aim to improve the tablet's stability within the MSFS environment.Â   PMDG has added data interoperability between the airplane and tablet, allowing users to see route changes reflected in the tablet's live map and providing increased situational awareness.  As it has been the norm since build 3.00.0080, the upcoming update will focus on the Universal Flight Tablet alone. The complete changelog follows below: 0012722: [EFB - General] Metars stop functioning between 0000z and 0100z (rmurdoch) 0012788: [EFB - General] PMDG map tiles names are fuzzy (rmurdoch) 0012777: [EFB - General] Fully convert to JSON for tablet-plane comms (rmurdoch) 0012782: [EFB - General] UFT 1.2 "New route loaded" message appears too often (rmurdoch) 0012475: [EFB - Simbrief] CO RTE field not showing CO RTE name (cbpowell) 0012783: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Arrival Airport Calls for Runway, not ICAO code. (cbpowell) 0012792: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Imported Flight plan times do not match Simbrief (cbpowell) 0012645: [EFB - General] Tablet map should pick up changes made on the FMS (rmurdoch) 0012692: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Landing Dispatch Data should be imported into Landing Enroute fields (cbpowell) 0012775: [EFB - General] Tablet namespace differentiation still not working correctly (rmurdoch) â They plan to release the update for PMDG.com customers around the final week of November.Â   Build 3.00.0082 has been submitted to Microsoft for the intake process, and PMDG believes it should become available sometime next week (Microsoft's intake process is not an exact science).  The Xbox version of the aforementioned build will take longer, as PMDG found issues with some key functions and is working with Microsoft and Asobo to find a solution.  The upcoming 777 is still being worked on, with PMDG's focus on handling characteristics and system validation. They claim it hasn't been previewed yet because they have been packing details and features into the new product that will demand time to get to where they want and that the previewing process will begin once it's nearing entering testing. PMDG believes this extra attention to development will yield a shorter testing cycle.  The current PMDG lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator is available on theirÂ website, ranging from $34.99 to $69.99.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

The German Zeppelin Airline Company operated it as a long-range passenger aircraft. The Hindenburg took its first flight on March 4, 1936; during that time, it was the largest aircraft ever built, coming in at nearly 800 feet long, three times the length of the Boeing 747. The LZ-129 carried 140,000 cubic meters of hydrogen. The LZ-129 was propelled through the air by ten Maybach engines, five mounted to the airframe as "engine cars." It could cruise at a maximum speed of 84 miles per hour and cruised at 78 miles per hour.  â The Hindenburg could carry up to 50+ passengers comfortably with spacious amenities. Passengers could reside between two different decks, A and B deck. The accommodation included promenade areas, dining rooms, lounges, a reading/writing room, and 25 cabins available for passengers. The aircraft had a smoking room, a kitchen crew, officer's mess hall, a bar, restrooms, and a pursers' office on B deck. The Hindenburg could travel up to 8,700 miles at around 1,500 feet, flying over 1,000 passengers during its operational lifetime. The Hindenburg took on ocean liners as a new alternative to transatlantic ocean liner travel.  â â Meeting its demise on May 6, 1937, in a fiery crash on approach to the naval facility in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The accident claimed the lives of 36 of the 97 people aboard. To this day, the cause of the explosion is still unknown but is thought to be due to a leak and static discharge from the atmosphere. â âHindenburg relives in Microsoft Flight Simulator thanks to Red WING Simulations. Red WINGS accurately recreated the model in its former glory by covering all the details of the original through accurate modeling and texturing based on blueprint drawings of the actual Hindenburg. The model features functional cockpits and engine decks, modeled decks with crew and passenger areas, and maintenance corridors. PBR texturing is incorporated into texturing as well.  â âThe flight model in Redwings has been designed with airship particularities in mind , with new A.I. roles included. This simulator takes you back to the early days of aviation communication, where Morse code was used. The electrical systems are faithfully recreated in the simulation, allowing you to complete tasks manually or with the assistance of the A.I. â The package will also include mooring mass such as the Empire State Building. Custom world maps for Hindenburg include weather details, drift headings displayed QDM/QDR ground stations, and more.  The flight model incorporates the effects of temperature, windspeeds, atmospheric pressures, ballast, gas volume, and other airship operational variables. The simulation also takes into account the need for repairs and routine maintenance. The package will also include additional liveries. The Hindenburg will be available soon for P.C. and XBOX. There is no official news of a release date yet, but RedWINGS indicates its release to be soon! To find out more, visit RedWINGS Facebook, website and Discord. Check out the launch trailer here on RedWINGS YouTube channel. As usual stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates!  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cera Sim has recently released the MI017V5, a Russian medium twin-turbine helicopter known by NATO as the "Hip," for Microsoft Flight Simulator, FSX, and Prepar3d V4+. This Mi-17 is mainly used for transport and other military purposes and has been a reliable asset for transporting troops for many different military forces worldwide. The Mi-17 has been in service since 1975 and has participated in many historic and current military operations. Many military forces worldwide operate the aircraft, including Mexico, the Indian Airforce, the Argentine Airforce, the Polish Military, the Philippine Airforce, and even China. The United States has a history of purchasing the Hip for Ukraine to assist in the Ukrainian Invasion. After almost 50 years of service and over twelve thousand built, the aircraft is still in development with over 40 variants for special missions, electronic warfare, combat, troop transport, flying hospitals, and passenger transport. Cera Sim has focused on the twin-turbined Mi-17 powered by TB-3-117A turboshaft engines. This setup allows the Hip to reach cruising speeds of up to 250km/h with a service ceiling of 6000m. Its maximum takeoff weight is around 13,000kg. Cera Sim has recreated an accurate rendition of the Hip for FSX and Microsoft Flight Simulator with various features such as animated doors, access hatches, and other components. The texturing is full PBR and HD, and the Hip's interior is also fully clickable with 3D gauges. The model features an EFB tablet for ease of use, which lets you control various tasks around the aircraft, such as doors, panel states, etc. The aural voice warning system is also fully simulated. The model comes with twelve different liveries and exterior models from civil, armored, and weaponized armored versions.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. DominicDesignTeam has recently released their rendition of Charleston International Airport (KCHS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Charleston County with a yearly average of 5.3 million passengers.  â It was built in the late 1920s by the Charleston Airport Corporation on 280 hectares of land from a mining company, with help from the City of Charleston in the 30s (they purchased a part of the land for passenger service). Within a decade, the runways were paved and lit up for nighttime operations.Â   â Control was briefly handed over to the US Army during WW2, but civilian services continued throughout the war.Â   â In 1949, a new passenger terminal was built from scratch. â It was once again handed over to the Army during the Korean War, with the city and the USAF reaching an agreement that has been renegotiated over time (and continues to this day).Â  â Boeing built a 787 manufacturing plant in 2009, with the first completed aircraft rolling out of the assembly line in early 2012.Â  â The passenger terminal has recently been overhauled, with a complete interior renovation and the construction of five new gates.Â  â Air Canada Express, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, dynamic lighting, real ground markings, custom ground textures, custom jetways, and more.  â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.10, requiring at least 1.22 GB of free hard disk space to install.
