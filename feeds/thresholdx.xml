    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SXAirportDesign has recently released their rendition of Antonio Rivera RodrÃ­guez Airport (TJVQ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the island of Vieques in Puerto Rico with a yearly average of 100,000 passengers.  It was built by the United States Navy in the mid-20th century as a small airstrip to support their military operations, only becoming a proper passenger airport after the army ceased training operations on the island in 2001.Â   It was renamed Antonio Rivera Rodriguez Airport in 2004 after a prominent Puerto Rican politician and former Mayor of Vieques.  Â There were plans to extend the runway in 2005 so smaller jets could fly into the airport, but it didnât work out. The current length (1,311 meters) only comports small regional aircraft.  Air Sunshine, Cape Air, M&amp;N Aviation, Silver Airways, and Vieques Air Link serve the airport.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations, in partnership with RPSimulations and a popular aviation channel from Brazil (AviÃµes &amp; MÃºsicas), has recently released a 14-bis for Microsoft Flight Simulator, first flown in 1906 and known (although not worldwide) as the worldâs first airplane.  Inspired by Gabriel Voisinâs glider, Santos Dumontâs 14-bis was made of a Hargrave-cell and powered by a 50 horsepower fuel-injected V8 engine, making it able to fly for a few hundred meters at a time at an impressive (by the early 1900s standards) 40 km/h.  It won the second prize in November 1906 at the Chateau de Bagatelle after flying for 220 meters, earning Santos Dumont a monument at the place, which is still up to this day.  The add-on accurately simulates the aircraftâs performance and flight dynamics based on its original documents.Â   Itâs available on theÂ GearDown Simulations StoreÂ for roughly $2.51 (limited-time offer).

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft released the A330 Project's website following their statement post Mathijs Kok's resignation a week ago. The new portal will update customers on the development progress, screenshots, upcoming features, and frequently asked questions.  Along with the brand new website, they have also published an update on the project's current status, covering their extensive effort in rebuilding the 3D model for Microsoft Flight Simulator and rewriting some of the systems.  Furthermore, they have mentioned it can now fly from A to B safely, with most systems working decently but with odd behavior still happening during testing because the flight management system and the autopilot were coded from scratch. Aerosoft has made a list with a few examples:   They are currently working on the soundscape, cockpit usability, and documentation.  There's yet to be any information on the release date or pricing, but Threshold will keep you informed!Â  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Pyreegue Dev Co. has recently released their rendition of East Midlands Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator (EGNX), serving the entire East Midlands region with a yearly average of 3 million passengers.  The airport started as RAF Castle Donington in 1943, sporting three concrete runways and two hangars, and it hosted the 28 Operational Training Unit and the 108 Operational Training Unit during the short WW2 stint. It was closed and decommissioned three years later, in 1946.  Then, in 1964, a group of local government agencies bought the former airfield, investing heavily in transforming it into a commercial airport. It was then renamed East Midlands Airport and got ready for passenger traffic in early 1965.  The airport saw heavy upgrade work in the early 2000s when the traffic figures increased significantly. It included an extension of the passenger terminal, new car parks, and a new pier.  Itâs an important cargo hub for DHL and UPS, which collaborate significantly to its second position in cargo traffic in the UK.  Airline-wise, itâs mostly an LCC airport, with the likes of Jet2.com (Alicante, Antalya, Faro, Fuerteventura, Funchal, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, MÃ¡laga, TenerifeâSouth), TUI (Alicante, Hurghada, Lanzarote, MÃ¡laga, Sharm El Sheikh, TenerifeâSouth), and Ryanair (Alicante, Barcelona, BelfastâInternational, Bergamo, Berlin, Budapest, Cork, Dublin, Faro, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Knock, KrakÃ³w, Lanzarote, Limoges, MÃ¡laga, Malta, Riga, RomeâCiampino, RzeszÃ³w, TenerifeâSouth, WrocÅaw).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with LiDAR elevation data, up-to-date satellite imagery, custom ground polygons with accurate weathering, an up-to-date airport layout, ATC/AI traffic integration, animated Skylink buses, dynamic gate doors (GSX is required), a custom GSX profile, a custom terminal interior, landside buildings, and more.  Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $22, requiring at least 3.56 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SamScene has recently released their rendition of Jeju International Airport (RKPC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in South Korea with a yearly average of 31 million passengers.  The airport was built as a military airfield in 1946 and only converted to civilian use in 1963. The first international flight to Osaka, Japan, only happened a year later.  In the early 90s, due to the constantly rising passenger volume, the government decided to build a much larger terminal, reaching completion in 1997. It has been one of the busiest airports in the country ever since.  Jeju International Airport is a major hub for Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, and it also serves many other airlines, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, EVA Air, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways.  The airport is currently operating at its capacity, so they are constructing a new one near the city of Seogwipo, expected to reach completion by 2025.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed terminal interior, custom night lighting, a detailed city center, iconic points of interest, custom ground markings, custom jetways, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.45, requiring at least 1.33 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. WingSim has recently released their rendition of El AlcaravÃ¡n Airport (SKYP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Yopal, Colombia.  It was built in the 1960s to serve the oil industry in the state, with Aerotaxi Casanare S/A handling most of the passenger traffic.Â   In the late 90s, petrol companies worldwide gathered together to improve the airportâs conditions so it could accommodate larger aircraft. The president landed with a Boeing 707 to inaugurate the improvements in late 1996.  Ten years later, the Camera de Comercio de Casanare (their Chamber of Commerce) asked the Ministry of Transport to make it an international airport, which was only granted many years later. Despite being classified as an international airport and having an immigration facility, it has no international flights.  Itâs currently served by Avianca, EasyFly, Latam Colombia, and Satena, with flights to BogotÃ¡ and Bucaramanga.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom night lighting, a terminal interior, hangars, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MSK Productions has recently released their rendition of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (VABB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Mumbai Metropolitan Region with a yearly average of 43 million passengers.  The airport started as a Royal Air Force airfield in the 1930s, housing multiple RAF squadrons during WW2, and was eventually handed over to the government to be converted into a civilian airport once the conflict had ceased.  The first expansion started in the 50s, with further work planned in the 60s but only executed in the late 70s, causing a lot of drama back then. Time magazine said the terminal was a âblack holeâ of sorts, and then a terminal building fire killed three passengers in 1979. It was overcrowded and unsafe.  The new terminal reached completion in 1980, costing 110 million rupees and temporarily solving the overcrowding. It was then modernized in the early 2000s, bringing it up to international standards.  It is currently the second busiest airport in India, after Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. Several airlines serve it, including Air India, IndiGo, Jet Airways, and SpiceJet.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, custom buildings, dynamic lighting, animated jetways, terminal 1 and 2 interiors, custom terraforming, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $22.23, requiring at least 380.25 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx hasÂ recently announcedÂ the development of two general aviation airfields, minutes apart from each other: S43 Harvey Field &amp; W16 Monroe First Air Field, both in Washington, United States.  Harvey Airfield is a privately-owned public-use airport in Sonomish (WA), categorized on the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems as a regional reliever facility. It was established in 1944 by the Harvey Family, getting a restaurant, an administration building, and a maintenance shop in 1947.Â   It is mainly used for flight training in general aviation airplanes and helicopters but also offers fuel and aircraft maintenance.  Monroe First Air Field is a public-use airport owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation. It opened in 1930 as a private airfield for Monroe Aircraft Corporation and was utilized in the following decade as a training base for the US Army.Â   The post-war saw the airfield become a general aviation facility, which continues to this day, even after its acquisition by the Washington State Department of Transportation in 1980.  Despite being small, it's considered a very important part of the state's history for its many purposes over its nearly 100 years of existence. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of both airfields, with custom dynamic lighting, full PBR 4K texturing, photo-realistic textures created with on-site photography, and more. â There is no release date or pricing information.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently launched their rendition of Harvey Field (S43) and Monroe Firstair (W16) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, both in Washington (United States) and only minutes apart from each other.Â   Harvey AirfieldÂ is a privately-owned public-use airport in Sonomish (WA), categorized on the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems as a regional reliever facility. It was established in 1944 by the Harvey Family, getting a restaurant, an administration building, and a maintenance shop in 1947.Â   It is mainly used for flight training in general aviation airplanes and helicopters but also offers fuel and aircraft maintenance.  Monroe First Air FieldÂ is a public-use airport owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation. It opened in 1930 as a private airfield for Monroe Aircraft Corporation and was utilized in the following decade as a training base for the US Army.Â   The post-war saw the airfield become a general aviation facility, which continues to this day, even after its acquisition by the Washington State Department of Transportation in 1980.  Despite being small, it's considered a very important part of the state's history for its many purposes over its nearly 100 years of existence.  The scenery features a reedition of two classics for FSX and Prepar3d, with meticulously crafted buildings based on on-site photography, 4K PBR textures, custom dynamic lighting, and more.  It's available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.48, requiring at least 4.62 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
