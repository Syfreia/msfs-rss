    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Melbourne Airport (YMML) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Melbourne in Australia with a yearly average of 25 million passengers. It is the second busiest airport in the country!  Built in the 60s and opened in 1970, it replaces Essendon Airport (Orbxâs home) as the cityâs main airport due to its relatively short runways, small terminals, and its expansion limitations that were a consequence of the urban development around the area.Â   During its first year of operations, Melbourne only handled international traffic, handling 155,275 international passengers that year and six airlines.Â   It originally featured three connected terminals, an international at the center, a terminal for Ansett to the south, and one for Trans Australia Airlines to the north. It could withstand 8 Boeing 707s and a rate of 500 passengers per hour, with expansion work three years later to comport the Boeing 747.  It wasnât long until the passenger figures increased drastically, forcing further expansion: the Ansett terminal, domestic, got bigger, followed by an upgrade to the international terminal in 1993 and the opening of a new three-level concourse in 1995, with ten additional jetways.  In 1997, Melbourne was privatized, on a 50-year long-term lease, followed by a series of upgrades and improvements, including the construction of a multi-story carpark with 3,100 parking spaces, a 276-room hotel, and the expansion of the Qantas domestic terminal with a second pier and nine additional stands.  In 2005, the airport underwent more construction work to become A380-ready, with a runway widening, the addition of dual jetbridges, a terminal extension, and a subsequent expansion of terminal 2 in 2006 and 2008, massively increasing its passenger handling capabilities.  The airport has 68 gates, 53 used for domestic operations and 15 for international.Â   The airport is a hub for Jetstar (Adelaide, Auckland, Ayers Rock, Ballina, BangkokâSuvarnabhumi, Brisbane, Busselton, Cairns, Canberra, Christchurch, Darwin, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Hobart, Ho Chi Minh City, Honolulu, Launceston, Newcastle, Perth, Phuket, Proserpine, Queenstown, Singapore, Sunshine Coast, Sydney, Townsville), Qantas (Adelaide, Alice Springs, Auckland, Ballina, Brisbane, Broome, Cairns, Canberra, Christchurch, Dallas/Fort Worth, Darwin, Delhi, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Â Hamilton Island, Hobart, Hong Kong, JakartaâSoekarno-Hatta, LondonâHeathrow, Los Angeles, Perth, Queenstown, Singapore, Sunshine Coast, Sydney, Wellington), Rex Airlines (Adelaide, Brisbane, Burnie, Canberra, Devonport, Gold Coast, King Island, Merimbula, Mildura, Mount Gambier, Sydney, Wagga Wagga), and Virgin Australia (Adelaide, Ballina, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, Darwin, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Hobart, Launceston, Nadi, Newcastle, Perth, Queenstown, Sunshine Coast, Sydney). The visitor list includes Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, LATAM Chile, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, and more.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, PBR texturing, interior terminal modeling of departure lounges, VDGS, custom traffic animations, crisp satellite imagery, custom ground clutter, custom POIs, LOD optimization, and a custom GSX profile.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $23.92, requiring at least 6.77 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>New SimWorks Studios update, regarding RV-10/14, Okavango delta and PC-12</title>
    <updated>2023-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/swsrop" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Developer Simworks Studios, renowned for their rendition of the Kodiak 100 for MSFS has recently provided a development update on their Discord and Facebook regarding the RV-10/14, Okavango delta, and their PC-12. â In light of the recent Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 announcement, SimWorks Studios has stated that as their existing add-ons follow the guidelines of the MSFS SDK, they believe that they will work fine in FS2024. They will update the installers to give users the option between MSFS2020 and MSFS2024 and users should be able to use the existing products without any paid upgrades. However, it's worth noting that if an add-on takes advantage of the new features exclusive to FS2024, such as the ability to perform specialized tasks, SimWorks Studios may choose to charge extra for such expansions. For example, if an aircraft like the Kodiak 100 requires additional work to enable the dropping of parachutists, an expansion product might be introduced with an associated cost. Nevertheless, if the existing add-ons continue to function flawlessly in FS2024 without any modifications, users can enjoy the enhancements without any additional charges. â In other news, developers have announced updates for the RV-10 and RV-14 aircraft, addressing minor code bugs and compatibility issues. The RV-10 update specifically focuses on resolving problems with the PMS50 GTN650 and GTN750, while the RV-14 update improves ground handling for the taildragger variant in the Microsoft Store version. These updates are expected to be available next week, benefiting both Microsoft Store and other vendors. â Furthermore, the much-anticipated update for Okavango Delta is set to arrive next week. This update brings a total of 14 new airstrips to the region, including Chitabe FBME, Delta FBDT, Kanana FBKK, Khwai FBKR, Mapula FBND, Ntswi FBND and camp, Pom Pom FBNO, Rann FBMQ, Sanctuary FBMB, Seronga FBSH, Shakawe FBSW, Shindi FBMJ and camp, Xaxaba FBXB and camp, and Xugana FBXG. Alongside the new airstrips, the update introduces hundreds of traveling animals, which exhibit realistic behavior, including running away if approached too closely. Additionally, minor fixes have been made to existing camps and airstrips, as well as improvements to animal LOD switching. â A sneak peek at the PC-12 interior textures has been unveiled, showcasing the level of detail and customization options available. The textures for both the cockpit and cabin are being refined and improved, allowing for a fully customizable experience.Â  â Repainters will appreciate the flexibility provided, as changing a few small textures will completely refurbish the cabin's look. The advantage of this approach is that it doesn't require large 4k textures for every livery, keeping the package size manageable. The cabin has already undergone significant changes, with a new kind of wood and carpeting, demonstrating the level of customization available to users. The developers have put great effort into ensuring that the textures and details of the PC-12's interior are of the highest quality. Turning our attention to the exterior of the aircraft, the model has undergone a final cleanup to add missing details and correct placements of various items. Flap actuators have been remodeled and animated, further enhancing the realism of the aircraft. The exterior is currently undergoing a final pass to ensure all aspects meet the highest standards and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. â So far no release date has been announced for the highly anticipated PC-12 however when we find out we will inform you here at Threshold.Â  â â â â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A2A Simulations announced their first new add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the Accu-Sim Comanche 250. Friday product announcementsÂ  FlightSim Expo 2023 included the Comanche 250, demoed featuring a unique approach to flight model feel and realism. A2A's owner, Scott Gentile, highlighted the details of the nearly finished aircraft in an interview with Two Tone Murphy during the convention; the interview was also published to their Youtube channel.  The big takeaway is the engine's wear, tear and scheduled maintenance requirements. Further highlights detail engine physics, friction, temperature simulations of internal components, and much more. A2A aims to keep each flight of the Comanche unique through wear and tear experienced through ownership of an aging general aviation piston. Scott also provides an explanation of the "feel" of the aircraft's aerodynamics while flying over New England. The setting then transitions to the simulator, demonstrating the feel of flying an light piston are well recreated. The also video shows the dynamics of flight animated Â as the aircraft moves through chop. The video then shifts focus to showcase the impact of aerodynamic effects and fuel loads on the airframe, as demonstrated by the left wing's reaction to changes in airflow. In addition the sound recording processes are also highlighted in the video above, make sure to check it out its worth the watch! â  A2A has a release aimed for this July. Of course, keep an eye on Threshold for more information on this upcoming release and continued coverage of FlightSim Expo 23. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Yesterday, iniBuilds revealed their âultimate airliner experienceâ to the world, initially teased in early June with an in-game screenshot of an engine. The mystery airplane is an Airbus A300-600 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, featuring realistic 3D models, true-to-life systems, full ACARS/CPDLC simulation, and more.  They claim to have completely re-created the exterior model, using 4K and 8K PBR textures with realistic decals, wear and tear, and dirt.Â   The detail also extends to its interior, with a fully modeled cockpit and cargo compartment and an extensive range of cargo loads varying from boxes to horses.Â   The airliner will feature a comprehensive systems simulation with a realistic flight model, full ACARS/CPDLC simulation, Navigraph charts compatibility, multiple liveries, a custom WWise sound set, and two variants: freighter and passengerâthe first to come on release and the latter after the release.  They also plan to include theÂ Primus Epic suiteÂ later down the line, with further updates on that to come in the future.  The Airbus A300-600 is an extended version of the A300B2 and B4, with two additional rows of seats, powered by two General Electric CF6-80C2 engines, and making use of the A310 cockpit, with no need for a flight engineer like the older A300s. 313 A300-600s were sold between its inception and 2007, when production stopped.  Thereâs still no pricing or release date information, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Sim-wings has recently released the second version of their Munich Airport (EDDM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing a complete rework of the previous version from late 2020 with new buildings, improved aerial imagery, and more.  Munich Airport is the 9th busiest airport in Europe, with a yearly average of 47.9 million passengers, serving the city of Munich and Upper Bavaria.Â   It opened in 1992, replacing Munich-Riem Airport, which served Munich from 1939 to 1992. It was deemed hard to expand because of the growing number of inhabitants around its proximity, leading to the desire to move the airport to a completely different location.Â   Construction work started in 1980 on the small village of Franzheim, whose 400 inhabitants were moved elsewhere. Operations began on 17 May 1992, with Riem closing the night before.  Itâs one of the main hubs for Lufthansa, flying worldwide. Condor, Eurowings, Eurowings Discover, and TUIfly Deutschland also use the airport as their bases.  The scenery features a high-detail rendition of Munich, with custom color-matched aerial orthoimagery, custom terraforming, detailed taxi lines, accurate replicas of the terminal and landside buildings, custom dynamic lighting, PBR texturing, custom ground textures, animated jetways, and VDGS compatibility.Â   Itâs available on theÂ Aerosoft StoreÂ for roughly $24.99, requiring at least 4 GB of free hard disk space to install. V1 owners are entitled to a free upgrade. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
