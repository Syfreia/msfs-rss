    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. A new F-104 Star Fighter is coming to X-Plane 12 Brought to you by Colimata! The Starfighter, developed by Lockheed, is a supersonic air superiority fighter designed to quickly claim control of enemy airspace. This required it to be super maneuverable and fast. The unique characteristics of its stubby wings, T-tail empennage, and dartish shape make it unmistakable from anything else. Later, it was developed into an all-role, multi-weather aircraft during the 60s, giving it more versatility. Over two thousand airframe variants were built, with the final retirement by the Italian Air Force in 2004, after serving for over fifteen air forces. The Starfighter was fast, designed with the GE J79 turbojet giving performance up to Mach 1.7, even increasing to Mach 2 for later variants. Max thrust produced 15,880 pounds in full burner and 10,000 at military power. The fuel system is supported by tip tanks, internal tanks, and pylons, totaling up to 12,260 lbs. Colimata shared previews of the upcoming aircraft via screenshots in this forum post. These images show off the loadmaster configuration interface, allowing you to load weapons from rockets to missiles and drop tanks to various hard points on the 104's airframe. The Star Fighter will have a custom radar supporting air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. These modes offer multiple levels of complexity based on the user's skill and avionics knowledge. C functions aid with targeting hostile aircraft and armaments. Citing Colimatas post, The package will include three variants, with each unique cockpits. These models range from the G variant, S, and the 21c with the most modern cockpit. Colimanta states that all variants will come with a "versatile" nav system that will work with X-Plane flight plans. Quoting Colimatas targeting system statement. â Further posts covered updates of external modeling. Colimata emphasizes details of the 3d model, such as animated systems and livery textures amounting to 4k high-resolution textures. Minor important details like the thousands of rivets, panel details, and decals across the airframe are accurately reproduced based on the real-world counterpart. Â  â â As for liveries, several will ship with the package, according to Colimata; of course, The famous, polished livery will be included. Colimata will also provide paint kits for the community's creative means of creating the numerous liveries associated with the Star Fighter. Progress is moving along strongly by their indication via their x-plane.org post with the aircraft variants in beta under shakedown testing.Â  A prospective release date has been announced for the F-104 FXP during the beginning of December.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has just launched the sixth edition of their FlightSim Community Survey, asking the community to answer questions ranging from their preferred flight simulation platform and add-ons to the hardware they use and why they simulate, providing a complete understanding of the modern flight sim demographic.Â   Averaging more than 20,000 respondents since the 2020 edition, the Survey has become the go-to reference for hardware metrics, given it differs massively compared to mainstream reference data such as the Steam Hardware Survey, which takes their entire user base into account. Focusing exclusively on flight simmers, it provides a more accurate image of the most popular hardware among virtual pilots.Â   It also sheds light on the most popular flight sim platform, intent (whether simulating just for fun or training for a pilotâs license), simulation proficiency, and how many of us are real-life pilots.Â   The Survey will run for ten days from today (November 17), and the results will be published on their website in December 2023. It is entirely GDPR compliant and fully anonymous, with no personally identifiable data being collected and no redirects.Â   ClickÂ hereÂ to participate in the worldâs most comprehensive flight simulation survey!

As it has been the norm since build 3.00.0080, the upcoming update will focus on the Universal Flight Tablet alone. The complete changelog follows below: 0012722: [EFB - General] Metars stop functioning between 0000z and 0100z (rmurdoch) 0012788: [EFB - General] PMDG map tiles names are fuzzy (rmurdoch) 0012777: [EFB - General] Fully convert to JSON for tablet-plane comms (rmurdoch) 0012782: [EFB - General] UFT 1.2 "New route loaded" message appears too often (rmurdoch) 0012475: [EFB - Simbrief] CO RTE field not showing CO RTE name (cbpowell) 0012783: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Arrival Airport Calls for Runway, not ICAO code. (cbpowell) 0012792: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Imported Flight plan times do not match Simbrief (cbpowell) 0012645: [EFB - General] Tablet map should pick up changes made on the FMS (rmurdoch) 0012692: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Landing Dispatch Data should be imported into Landing Enroute fields (cbpowell) 0012775: [EFB - General] Tablet namespace differentiation still not working correctly (rmurdoch) â They plan to release the update for PMDG.com customers around the final week of November.Â   Build 3.00.0082 has been submitted to Microsoft for the intake process, and PMDG believes it should become available sometime next week (Microsoft's intake process is not an exact science).  The Xbox version of the aforementioned build will take longer, as PMDG found issues with some key functions and is working with Microsoft and Asobo to find a solution.  The upcoming 777 is still being worked on, with PMDG's focus on handling characteristics and system validation. They claim it hasn't been previewed yet because they have been packing details and features into the new product that will demand time to get to where they want and that the previewing process will begin once it's nearing entering testing. PMDG believes this extra attention to development will yield a shorter testing cycle.  The current PMDG lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator is available on theirÂ website, ranging from $34.99 to $69.99.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Dreamfoil Creations, known for their Embraer 110 and Bell 407 for X-Plane, have released their rendition of the Schweitzer S300. The new helicopter is available for X-Plane 12 and will bring users an in-depth experience with this retro helicopter. The Schweizer S300CBi is a light utility helicopter originally designed by Hughes Helicopters and later produced by Schweizer. The S300CBi is the fuel-injected version of the S300CB which helps alleviate carburetor icing. The S300 is commonly used for cost-effective training and agricultural purposes. Equipped with a 180hp Lycoming HO-360-C1A, the S300 boasts a maximum payload of 950 lbs (around 430kg) and a range of 195nm. The Dreamfoil S300CBi features a VR-compatible cockpit that includes a smart menu for easy navigation. Dreamfoil has also included full PBR textures, custom animations, enhanced night lighting, and removable doors. One feature that's not common on many products that users can expect is interchangeable exhaust options that change the engine sound. Another feature users can look forward to is the comprehensive external objects pack.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flight Sim Studios, known for their Embraer E-Jet release, has now developed the Traveler. The Tecnam Traveler is a dual-piston engine aircraft widely used by commuter airlines as feeders to their route systems. The Italian aircraft manufacturer unveiled the P2012 Traveller in April 2011. CapeAir was the largest buyer, seeking to replace its aging Cessna 402 fleet. The first flight of the Traveler took place in July 2016, entering service in February 2020. Two Lycoming TEO-540C1A six-cylinder engines power the aircraft and can seat nine passengers. It can cruise at an average speed of 170 knots and reach a maximum altitude of 19,500 feet. The aircraft is versatile and can be configured for many different missions, such as cargo, medivac, personal/corporate, and more. Flight Sim Studios has launched a detailed recreation of the Tecnam Traveler for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which includes PBR texturing to capture material and surface details from the exterior to the interior. The model consists of a set of liveries used in real-world applications. Several mission models include Airliner, Cargo, Combi Medieval Skydiving setups, and a special Mission Platform configuration. The model uses a customized version of the G1000 NXI by Working Title, with custom CAS messages, custom engine pages, the GMC225 autopilot system, and a working FMS keyboard. FADEC systems are also modeled for the two Lycoming engines. Ease of use features include an EFB tablet with aircraft config options, moving maps, panel state loading, FSS Mission hub, and more. Custom sounds cover the entire aircraft as well.  The aircraft's flight model, system workflows, and walkaround modes are tuned and influenced by actual Traveler pilots. Flight Sim Studios also provides a 40-minute video documentation of the real aircraft and procedures. The Tecnam P2012Traveler can be purchased via Contrail for $37.25.

    <title>Redwings Simulations announces the upcoming release of the Hindenburg</title>
    <updated>2023-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/redwing" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. â Redwings Simulations announces the upcoming release of the Hindenburg via their Facebook page and Discord Channel. Redwings Simulations is known for bringing the Lockheed Super Connie to the Microsoft flight simulator. â The Hindenburg was the largest airship ever designed and built by the German aircraft company Zeppelin. The German Zeppelin Airline Company operated it as a long-range passenger aircraft. The Hindenburg took its first flight on March 4, 1936; during that time, it was the largest aircraft ever built, coming in at nearly 800 feet long, three times the length of the Boeing 747. The LZ-129 carried 140,000 cubic meters of hydrogen. The LZ-129 was propelled through the air by ten Maybach engines, five mounted to the airframe as "engine cars." It could cruise at a maximum speed of 84 miles per hour and cruised at 78 miles per hour.  â The Hindenburg could carry up to 50+ passengers comfortably with spacious amenities. Passengers could reside between two different decks, A and B deck. The accommodation included promenade areas, dining rooms, lounges, a reading/writing room, and 25 cabins available for passengers. The aircraft had a smoking room, a kitchen crew, officer's mess hall, a bar, restrooms, and a pursers' office on B deck. The Hindenburg could travel up to 8,700 miles at around 1,500 feet, flying over 1,000 passengers during its operational lifetime. The Hindenburg took on ocean liners as a new alternative to transatlantic ocean liner travel.  â â Meeting its demise on May 6, 1937, in a fiery crash on approach to the naval facility in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The accident claimed the lives of 36 of the 97 people aboard. To this day, the cause of the explosion is still unknown but is thought to be due to a leak and static discharge from the atmosphere. â âHindenburg relives in Microsoft Flight Simulator thanks to Red WING Simulations. Red WINGS accurately recreated the model in its former glory by covering all the details of the original through accurate modeling and texturing based on blueprint drawings of the actual Hindenburg. The model features functional cockpits and engine decks, modeled decks with crew and passenger areas, and maintenance corridors. PBR texturing is incorporated into texturing as well.  â âThe flight model in Redwings has been designed with airship particularities in mind , with new A.I. roles included. This simulator takes you back to the early days of aviation communication, where Morse code was used. The electrical systems are faithfully recreated in the simulation, allowing you to complete tasks manually or with the assistance of the A.I. â The package will also include mooring mass such as the Empire State Building. Custom world maps for Hindenburg include weather details, drift headings displayed QDM/QDR ground stations, and more.  The flight model incorporates the effects of temperature, windspeeds, atmospheric pressures, ballast, gas volume, and other airship operational variables. The simulation also takes into account the need for repairs and routine maintenance. The package will also include additional liveries. The Hindenburg will be available soon for P.C. and XBOX. There is no official news of a release date yet, but RedWINGS indicates its release to be soon! To find out more, visit RedWINGS Facebook, website and Discord. Check out the launch trailer here on RedWINGS YouTube channel. As usual stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates!  â</summary>
