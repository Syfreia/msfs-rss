    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Burning Blue Design has recently released their rendition of H. A. Clark Memorial Field (KCMR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a public-use general aviation airport in Williams, Arizona, with a yearly average of 16,100 operations. â It was built in 1925 as Webber Field, yet left to deteriorate during its initial years until the advent of the Civilian Pilot Training Program in 1939, which helped to rekindle the interest in aviation in Williams. On the other hand, the airfield's development predated the increased interest, with work starting in 1935, followed by a further $140000 investment in 1940 from the Civil Aeronautics Board. â The many upgrades eventually drew the attention of the US Army, which used the field from 1942 to train cadets. Seven army instructors were stationed there during that period, training 30 people. â Its 1,830-meter-long runway might seem long, but the aerodromeâs elevation (6,691ft) makes it somewhat challenging.Â Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airfield, with over 120 custom objects, accurate taxiways, a high-detail terminal building interior, detailed hangars with interiors, custom flags and windsocks, custom night lighting, and color-corrected ground textures.  Itâs available on Burning Blue DesignâsÂ websiteÂ for roughly $13.78. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios has recently released their rendition of Dunedin Airport (NZDN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the entire region of Otago with a yearly average of 1 million passengers, making it the third busiest airport in the country.  The airport was built in 1962 to replace Dunedinâs former airfield (Taieri), which was deemed unfeasible to expand in the future. Commercial service started that same year with NZAC and their Fokkers.Â   The terminal was upgraded in the late 60s-early 70s with automatic sliding doors, a new mezzanine floor, and an aircraft viewing deck.  Itâs currently served by Air New Zealand and Jetstar, with flights to Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington (Jetstar only flies to Auckland).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with updated aerial imagery, custom ground poly, hand-made animated jetways, HD PBR models, a basic interior for the terminal and hangars, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $7.54, requiring at least 4.05 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their rendition of Seattle Paine Field International Airport (KPAE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Snohomish County, Washington, with a yearly average of 377,000 passengers.  The airport was built in 1936 as a Works Program Administration project, envisioned as a job creator, economic booster in the region, and one of the future âsuper airportsâ in the United States. â It was taken over by the Army during World War 2, only to be transferred back to Snohomish County in 1948, with the Air Force still maintaining various Air Defense Command units at the airport as military tenants. â The âsuper airportâ plans were revived briefly because the Korean War forced the airport to become an air force base. It was only returned to civilian use in the 1960s.  â Boeing chose Paine Field as the construction and testing site for their Boeing 747 project in 1966, where it also made its first landing three years later. â After years of debate about using the airport for commercial service, they finally reached an agreement, with a passenger terminal being constructed in 2017, featuring 30,000 square meters of area, two gates, and the ability to handle up to 16 flights a day. â Itâs served by Alaska Airlines (Anchorage, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Orange County, PhoenixâSky Harbor, San Diego, San Francisco) and Kenmore Air (Eastsound, Friday Harbor, Victoria). â â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with the Boeing factory and their 777X production line (fully animated), performance-friendly optimization, custom animated people and vehicles, GSX Pro compatibility (using Cartayna files), modeled interiors, custom jetways, and more. â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $24.86, requiring at least 1.40 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (PHNL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Hawaiian city of Honolulu with a yearly average of 18.3 million passengers.  It opened in March 1927 as John Rodgers Airport, after a WW1 naval officer. It was the first full airport in Hawaii, as they only had landing strips, fields, and seaplane docks beforehand. â After Pearl Harbor, the airport became Naval Air Station Honolulu, with a control tower built by the Navy, a terminal building, and passenger traffic was even allowed during daylight hours. It was returned right after the war, in 1946.Â  â It was renamed âHonolulu Airportâ in 1947 and internationalized in 1951. It became an important stop for many transpacific flights, rapidly becoming one of the busiest airports in the United States. It even had the longest runway in the world (back in 1953), at a then-impressive 3,992 meters.  The original terminal was replaced by a new one in 1962, which was eventually modernized in the 70s by Vladimir Ossipoff, who entirely remodeled the terminal and added new concourses.  In the early 2000s, Ossipoffâs modern terminal was not so modern anymore, and the âforward-lookingâ and flexible design was showing its age, facing the challenges of the modern standards of accessibility, comfort, and security. In response, the government unveiled a 2.3 billion USD modernization program for all Hawaiian airports over 12 years, with 1.7 billion for Honolulu alone.  Many infrastructure upgrades were made during that period, and a new concourse was built between 2018-2021, featuring gates that can easily accommodate widebody jets, making life easier for Hawaiian Airlines passengers that will no longer have to walk between terminals for overseas departures.  The current layout sports three terminals, with 54 jetways and six stands. Terminal 1 has 25 jetways, 2 has 29, and 3 has parking stands.Â   Itâs a hub for Aloha Air Cargo, Asia Pacific Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Mokulele Airlines, Transair, and Corporate Air. The visitorsâ list includes Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Fiji Airways, Japan Airlines, Jetstar, Korean Air, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, WestJet, and Zipair Tokyo. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, Â hand-made textures, high-quality surrounding POIs, true-to-life landside recreation, an official GSX profile, dynamic lighting, and a detailed terminal interior.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $25.17, requiring at least 5.36 GB of free hard disk space. 10% of all revenue will be donated to the American Red Cross for the Hawaiian Wildfire crisis.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. SXAD has recently released their rendition of San Antonio International Airport (KSAT) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving Greater San Antonio with a yearly average of 9.4 million passengers, placing it among the busiest airports in Texas.  The airport was inaugurated in 1941, built on 490 ha of undeveloped land that was quickly taken by the US Army for training during WW2, then named Alamo Field. It hosted the 77th Reconnaissance Group, training personnel for overseas operations.  The end of the war saw its return to the city of San Antonio, followed by the construction of a second terminal in the early 1950s, along with a control tower and a baggage claim area. Then, in the late 60s, a new concourse was built with eight jet bridge gates.  In the mid 70s, a master plan was put into action to further develop the airport, with a new 33,000 square meters terminal and a larger parking garage, bringing the airport from eight to twenty seven gates.  Twenty years later, it was once again upgraded with a new parking garage that only reached completion in 2007.  In 2010, the old second terminal was closed, replaced by a brand new terminal with eight gates, designed by Corgan Associates, Inc. and 3D/International.Â   AeromÃ©xico Connect, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, United Express, VivaAerobus, and Volaris currently serve the airport.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom seasonal orthoimagery, custom PBR ground textures, baked night lighting and ambient occlusion, custom airport surroundings, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $19.99, requiring at least 1.2 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published another development update concerning the progress on the UFT, pending 737 marketplace updates, and their upcoming 777 for Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Randazzo begins with a note on how their Universal Flight Tablet is progressing, claiming âthings are getting exciting,â with weekly updates being pushed to the beta team to ensure itâs appropriately polished. While they do not have a release date yet, itâs said to be getting closer. Their testers are currently testing the performance calculators while PMDG refines the EFBâs functionality based on their feedback.  The tablet has also been fitted into the 777, and the testing of that plane will be simultaneous with its normal beta testing, meaning it will be there from day one. The airplane, on the other hand, is still under development, and they claim itâs bringing a tremendous improvement in performance, resource utilization, and visual quality and is fairly more integrated with the simulator.  The marketplace updates are running six weeks behind because Microsoft has made some changes to their intake and approval process, dragging on for a little longer than it used to, to no fault of their own (according to their claims).  Their 737 Lineup is available on theirÂ websiteÂ and the MSFS Marketplace, ranging from $34.99 to $69.99 depending on variant.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSDG has recently released their rendition of Hurghada International Airport (HEGN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in Egypt, serving the coastal city of Hurghada.  It was inaugurated in 1988, quickly becoming a gateway to the Red Sea Riviera. Expansions were made in the 90s and 2000s to keep up with the ever-increasing passenger figures. It played a pivotal role in transforming Hurghada into one of the busiest tourist destinations in Egypt because of its strategic location, close to the Red Sea, offering many summer activities.  The airport is served by Air Cairo, Brussels Airlines, Chair Airlines, Condor, Corendon, easyJet, Edelweiss Air, Egyptair, FlyArna, Luxair, Marabu, Pegasus Airlines, Smartwings, Sundair, TUI Airways, TUI fly Belgium, TUI fly Deutschland, TUI fly Netherlands, Turkish Airlines, and WizzAir. The list does not include the many seasonal charters serving the airport during summer. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom landside, updated ground layout, dynamic lighting, custom ground textures, and custom clutter, and it also includes the El Gouna private airport (HEGO). â Itâs available on theÂ FSDG StoreÂ for roughly $27.00.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The Leading Edge Simulationsâ Douglas DC-3 v2 store page is up on X-Aviation with a release date, features, and official documentation.Â   â Releasing on Thursday, the DC-3 v2 for X-Plane 12 will feature two different variations: classic and modern, with the first one replicating the early production layouts from the 1930s and 1940s and the latter sporting modern instruments and avionics, fully developed custom systems with accurately simulated electric logic, two autopilot options, simulated engines, hydraulics, and fuel system; custom fmod sounds, particle system effects, and a maintenance system where every aircraft operation is tracked and logged. â â â  It will accompany a modern user interface with airframe information, maintenance, customization options, loadsheet control, and a checklist.Â  â â The developers also disclaim a list of things that will not be available right on release: the hydraulic system has correct indications, but X-Plane does not allow for deep interaction with it; the anti-ice systems are present yet not fully simulated; hardware support is said to be âbasicâ for the time being; the Sperry autopilot on the âClassicâ variant doesnât have heading mode, only the basic operations. â  The add-on will be available next Thursday onÂ X-AviationÂ for $49.95.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Navigraph Adds Flight Telemetry, ATIS, OFP Reader to Charts</title>
    <updated>2023-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has released an update adding three brand new features to their popular Charts software. â The main feature within this update is the addition of digital ATIS. Users can now go to the âWeatherâ section within any airport on the map view, and view that airportâs current ATIS, along with live METAR and TAF information. The data for the ATIS can come from multiple different sources, including VATSIM, IVAO, and PilotEdge. At many larger airports within the United States, the ability to pull real-world digital ATIS information is also possible.  Navigraph has also added Flight Telemetry monitoring. This feature allows users to pull current aircraft information from the simulator, such as airspeed, altitude, ground speed, estimated time to destination, and much more. This feature can be personalized within the app, with the ability to pick and choose what information is displayed, or it can be completely turned off if desired. Finally, the team has added the ability to display Operational Flight Plans from SimBrief. This feature allows users to, according to Navigraph, make their flight planning process smoother and more efficient. This feature even more closely integrates Navigraphâs Charts product with the very popular SimBrief, after being acquired by Navigraph in 2021. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>
