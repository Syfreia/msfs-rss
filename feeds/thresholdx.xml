    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Tailstrike Designs and Windsock Simulations have recently released Airport Bergamo v2 for X-Plane 11. The airport, a leap forward compared to its original version, brings updated terminals, animated jet bridges, and redesigned surrounding details. According to the sceneryâs store page, Airport Bergamo v2 will reflect the latest layout of its real life counterpart in 2021, including the new north apron. It will feature high quality PBR textures, custom made signage, and full surrounding details instead of blurry satellite images. 	Additionally, the developers have indicated that scenery will have minimal impact on the performance of the simulators, ensuring that users can have a smooth flying experience. It is recommended that users have at least 4GB of free disk space in order to successfully install the product. 	Currently, the product can be purchased on simMarket or Aerosoftâs webstore for EUR 20.13 or USD 20.91. Owners of Airport Bergamo V1 for X-Plane can purchase the new version for a reduced price of EUR 10.07. Credits to Lazerzen from the Threshold Discord for the news scoop.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Last week, Just Flight announced their newest project for Microsoft Flight Simulator - the Tornado GR1. The Tornado GR1, a step up from the developerâs Hawk T1, will bring the perfect experience for pilots looking for the thrill of high speed, low altitude flying. According to the developers, the Tornado GR1 will feature 8k textures and study-level systems. Judging by the pictures provided, the exterior and cockpit of the jet have been completely modeled and textured, including moving parts such as spoilers and reverse thrust buckets. At this stage, no feature list or any additional details have been provided, though the team promised to keep the community updated on the aircraftâs progress.  Tornado GR1, a collaboration between the UK, West Germany, and Italy, is designed to be a multirole military aircraft capable of carrying out a variety of anti-ground, intercepting, and air defense suppression missions. First produced in 1979, different variants of the Tornado saw action in the Gulf War of 1991, âBosnian War, Kosovo War, Iraq War, in Libya during the 2011 Libyan civil war, as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syriaâ. Currently, the developers are yet to announce the release date and pricing of the jet aircraft. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. A familiar face with an unfamiliar name will be launching the reincarnation of the Mitsubishi MU-2 for X-Plane this week, with Tom Kyler -- most notably of IXEG -- completely overhauling the now 14 year old product. The product's release will coincide with the gazetting of a new name: X-Scenery is no more and will be replaced with TOGA Simulations to better align with the products the brand makes. The Mitsubishi MU-2 has been a prominent fixture on the X-Aviation store since its creation in 2008. In fact, it was the first product ever sold on the platform according to Cameron Son, the store's owner. Speaking on the X-Pilot forum, Son made the following announcement.  "Today, we're officially announcing Friday, July 15, 2022 as the release date for v2 of this great aircraft! This isn't just an update to the existing aircraft! It's an entirely new code base, 3D model and FMOD sound simulation. It is truly a new product." A specific release time was not given, though the American-based company said they're aiming for 'the afternoon on Friday'. Further information is expected in the coming days. There's been no word of a price yet either. This will be unveiled once the product page goes live later this week. Previous customers of the MU-2 can expect a $20 discount on v2, though these coupons will only be available for 60 days.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Software house SimWorks Studios have come forward today with more information on a large-scale update to their Quest Kodiak 100 aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The details were shared via Facebook, with today's update focusing primarily on the handling characteristics of the aircraft. "Here is an update on the Kodiak packages. A big flight model update was delivered to us this past week, which will improve the response of the aircraft," the team wrote on social media. "Many people complained that the plane was very sensitive to pitch input, something we attributed to the short travel that most desktop yokes have." "After a long time of tweaking and balancing, the next update will improve this aspect of the Kodiak's handling." The new flight model also rectifies the Kodiak's performance, giving a more accurate reflection of the American aircraft after Sim Update 8 left the high-wing somewhat underpowered. The amphibian edition of the Kodiak is also seeing some nice progress according to the developer, even given "MSFS' flight model limitations" in this area. Before release, the aircraft will see some last fine tuning and get a sign off from Quest's parent company Daher. Speaking of a release window, SimWorks have said that both the wheeled Kodiak update and new Amphibian variant should be coming out after Sim Update 10 launches in mid- to late-August. This is to take advantage of new features coming in that update. See the source post for this article on Facebook.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Polish scenery creator MK Studios has launched two new airports today, with both North and South Tenerife Airports (GCXO and GCTS respectively) combined into one scenery package. For previous simulator platforms, such as Prepar3D version 5, the developer opted to sell the airports separately. "Welcome to Tenerife, the largest and most populous island of the Canary Islands," reads the product description. "The island of Tenerife has two airports: the Tenerife North Airport (or Los Rodeos) and Tenerife South Airport (or Reina Sofia). The south airport is situated in a tourist area, and therefore is the busiest, having hundreds of connections to different parts of the world. Tenerife North Airport operates mostly domestic flights between the islands of the archipelago." "In this package, we recreated these two airports, GCTS and GCXO, and added a few POIs with custom satellite images and mesh." The aerodrome pair package includes the following features: You can purchase MK Studios' Tenerife for EUR 15.99 from simMarket or $23.95 AUD (approx. US$16.19 | â¬16,14 | Â£13.68) from OrbxDirect.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. On 22th of July 2022, they announced they had advanced the work on the VC animations, the FMS, and the flight dynamics. As for the external model, they work mainly on the landing gear. There were no other changes on the textures, as other exterior details are still to be finalized. The flight model has also been developed, but it is unknown to what extent. The developers simply say that there is still a lot of work to be done on this aspect. This update primarily adresses the modelling of the FMSÂ and the programming of its various components. As per the update, the developer states that the VCÂ animations 90% complete, although the devs then state that many switches still need to be integrated.Â Readdressing the FMS, the devs strongly emphasize the priority the FMSÂ has in development. Once the FMSÂ is complete, other systems will be worked on and addressed. If you are interested in reading the full update for yourself, you may view it on JustFlight's website. The work is still in progress, and no release date has been announced yet. Threshold will keep you updated on any futher updates.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Bridger Aerospace, a real-life firefighting company, is now using VR simulation to train its pilots to fly in complex conditions, like flying low to put out a forest fire. The simulator they will be using? X-Plane. During real life training, it is impossible to accurately reproduce the conditions of wildfires pilots will be expected to put out. Only simulation and virtual reality can realistically recreate such extreme conditions. On top of this, pilots can even train in the same virtual aircraft using the âshared cockpitâ model from completely different locations - drastically increasing training efficiency and reducing overall cost.  Pretoria Engineering, a real life group of engineers from the University of Astoria, are designing the plug-in for X-Plane 12. When completed, it will integrate Bridgerâs aircraft with the ability to fly ultra realistic aerial firefighting missions. Such an integration of X-Plane into pilot training programs is proof that flight simulation is so much more than a video game - it is capable of not only fulfilling the dream of aviation enthusiasts but also playing a critical role in the training of pilots for an array of possible scenarios they may encounter in real life. â</summary>
