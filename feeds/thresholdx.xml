    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Spaceport America (9NM9) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, an FAA-licensed spaceport in New Mexico (United States) for vertical and horizontal launch space vehicles, launched in 2011 and deemed ready for operations in 2019.Â  Owned and operated by the State of New Mexico, it is the first purpose-built commercial spaceport, focusing solely on commercial operations. Itâs home to companies such as HAPSMobile and SpinLaunch, and a hub for Virgin Galactic, Up Aerospace, and Exos Aerospace.Â  Its concept was first introduced in 1990 by Dr. Burton Lee, a Stanford University engineering lecturer. Responsible for writing the initial business and strategy plans, he secured 1.4 million dollars in seed funding, aided by Senator Pete Domenici. In 1992, they formed the Southwest Space Task Force, focusing on advancing New Mexicoâs space industryÂ  infrastructure and activity-wise. After lots of research, they chose a 70 square kilometer plot of state-owned land, near Las Cruces, to build the spaceport. In 2003, the Economic Development Cabinet Secretary Rick Homans presented the idea to Governor Bill Richardson, which then reached an agreement with Sir Richard Branson from Virgin to make New Mexico the headquarters for Virgin Galactic and consequently facilitate it for the state laws to be enacted and authorize the construction of the airport.Â  The scenery was built with PBR textures, accurately replicating the real-life counterpart as it looks in 2022. The complete feature list follows down below: â Itâs available for purchase on FlightSim.to for $7.49 or on UK2000âs website for Â£7.49, requiring at least 77 MB of free disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight have released a new development update on their upcoming RJ Professional series. Announced officially on the 15th of August 2022, the RJ professional line is set to be a more modern and streamlined version of their previous â146 Professionalâ addon. Differences include slightly larger and more powerful engines, but the most significant difference comes in the flight deck! The RJ professional line will boast an all-new EFIS system replacing the traditional analogue ADI, HSI and engine instruments.Â  In providing an update on the development process, JustFlight has said: âThe interior and cockpit modelling and texturing has been undergoing extensive testing in recent weeks, with every rivet, screw and label being compared to its real-life counterpart, to ensure 100% accuracy. After spending many months developing the 146, itâs been interesting to see just how much was improved and upgraded in the later RJ, and how all come together to reduce pilot workload without losing the appeal of the aircraft.â JustFlight has informed us that throughout the cockpit the majority of instruments are now âaliveâ and being fine-tuned. The other significant bit of work to take place has been the development of over 30 different true-to-life liveries which will be released with the aircraft!Â  To read more from JustFlight's latest RJ development update click here! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. With X-Plane 12, there have come many improvements from the previous versions of X-Plane. Notably in Xplane 11, the built-in ATC function was somewhat lacking depth, this has been addressed and overhauled with an all-new system for XP12!Â  In a post on the X-plane website, Laminar Research discusses about the various ATC system improvements in their most recent version of the X-Plane series.Â Â  New features include:Â  Perhaps the most significant improvement to the ATC system however is the addition of global regions, X-Plane will now follow procedures and use voices that are suitable for different regions of the world. This is a huge improvement on the previous system which in essence treated the entire world as if it followed FAA procedures.Â  Another big improvement to the built-in ATC system is the quality of VHF communications, this will now change, taking into account your distance from the controller, relative altitude, the type of controller, and any blocking terrain that may be around you.Â  The ATC dialogue menu has also received an overhaul making it more intuitive.Â  This is a big step in the right direction to improving the overall experience with Xplane, although many agree from participating in the latest public beta, it still has a long way to go.Â  â Threshold will keep you up to date with all the latest news! </summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Origami Studios has worked hard to get this project released in the last two days after announcing its development for X-Plane 12. London Heathrow (EGLL) is the busiest airport in the United Kingdom and within the top 10 in the world! Founded in 1946 and originally known as London Airport, it was renamed London Heathrow in 1966. It used to have six runways, placed in a Star-Of-David pattern. As Heathrow became bigger and bigger over the years, it was decided there was no longer a need for the 3 of Heathrowâs four diagonal runways, culminating on their closure by the 1970âs, leaving one runway intact (05/23), eventually decommissioned in 2003 for an extension of an existing terminal. Itâs the hub for British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, and they cater for many other airlines that fly in and out daily from different countries. It has four passenger terminals which can see over 78 million passengers a year, according to data shown in 2017, heading to and from 185 countries around the world. Fun fact, did you know that aircraft had to be moved from the Terminal 4 remote stands when runway 23 was in use? Origami Studios have brought out a massive asset to X-Plane 12. Including custom buildings, a highly detailed rendition of Terminal 5, landmarks and moving jetways. â Key Features: Want to fly to the busiest UK airport in X-Plane 12?
