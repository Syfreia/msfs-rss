    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BEAUTIFUL MODEL of the WORLD and AmSim have teamed up once again to build and release a rendition of Memphis International Airport (KMEM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the primary international airport serving Memphis, covering 1,600 hectares of land, sporting four runways, and averaging 4 million passengers a year as of recent.Â   Mainly a cargo airport, known as the FedEx Superhub, it processes a significant number of packages per year, featuring many nonstop destinations all across the globe, along with a network of domestic routes all over the continental United States. For 16 years (between 1993 and 2009), MEM used to be the busiest cargo airport in the World, overtaken by Hong Kong Intl. in 2010 but remained the busiest cargo airport in the country and the entire western hemisphere until 2020, when the COVID-19 eCommerce boom made it take the first place once again, although rather briefly.Â   Passenger-wise, it averages 80 flights a day, with Delta Airlines being the market share leader with 21.33% (828,000) of the total number of passengers between 2021 and 2022. American Airlines is second, with 20.36% (790,000), and Southwest is third, with 18.47% (717,000). As far as destinations are concerned, Atlanta is the busiest, with 422,000 passengers, followed by Dallas-Fort Worth and Charlotte, with 257,000 and 190,000, respectively.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with a fully modeled terminal interior, animated jetways, high-resolution custom ground textures, surrounding buildings fully modeled, parallax windows, airline codes assigned to each parking, and FSLTL compatibility.Â   Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $22.73, requiring at least 2.53 GB of free disk space to install.

    <title>Orbx Releases Launceston Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Launceston Airport (YMLT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second-busiest airport in Tasmania after Hobart, with a yearly average of 1,500,000 passengers (pre-pandemic).  Qantas Group is the biggest operator in the airport, with their subsidiary (JetStar) offering up to six daily flights to and from Melbourne, two daily flights to and from Sydney, and one daily flight to Brisbane. Virgin Australia offers a similar selection with five daily flights to and from Melbourne, one to Sydney, and seasonal flights on select days to Brisbane. Airlines of Tasmania and Sharp Airlines offer a variety of short legs to nearby destinations. Its origins date back to the early 1930s, when it was established as a small grass runway for regional flights, then called The Western Junction Aerodrome. It was officially opened as a government aerodrome in 1931 when over 20,000 people watched Colonel Brinsmead - then controller of civil aviation - âcut the inaugural ribbon.â From 1932 and beyond, small aircraft would fly from Launceston to Flinders Island.  During WW2, it was used by the Royal Australian Air Force as a flight school, preparing pilots for combat. It was the only RAAF air base in Â Tasmania. Two of the hangars are still around to this day.  In the early 60s, plans for a Major redevelopment were approved, which included a runway extension, pavement strengthening, and a new terminal building. In 1982, the runway was once again extended to allow for the operation of Boeing 767s. The current privatization came in 1998, with joint ownership between the Launceston City Council and Australia Pacific Airports Corporation. The post-9/11 crisis and the rise of low-cost airlines made the airport grow in passenger traffic, reaching one million passengers for the first time in 2007.  Such exponential growth demanded another expansion, which doubled the size of the terminal and reached completion in November 2009, costing 20 million Australian dollars.  Developed by Ken Hall, an indie, who happens to be from the region and had exclusive access to the airport, taking hundreds of reference pictures to help with the accuracy and even allow for extra realism on the texturing side of things. It features a faithful recreation of the airport as it currently stands, with PBR texturing, static aircraft, detailed hangars, and terminal building. Itâs available on Orbx Direct for roughly $17.03, requiring at least 2.65 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Releases Boeing 737-700 on MSFS' Marketplace</title>
    <updated>2023-01-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDGâs Boeing 737-700 is now available on Microsoft Flight Simulator's marketplace, only on PC at this time and priced at $69.99 (pricing may vary per region).Â  â The marketplace version is almost identical to the PMDG Store counterpart, featuring three different variations: passenger, BBJ, and cargo, all with accurately represented systems, a high-fidelity flight model, PBR textures, a realistic flight deck, and different cabins matching the chosen variation, along with the ability to pick between winglets or split scimitars. The only difference between both is that the Marketplace version does not come with the Operations Center, which is obtainable from their official downloads section. Updates might also take longer, as the files need to be approved by Microsoft before being pushed to the marketplace. The Boeing 737-700 is a single-aisle, twin-engine jetliner that is part of the 737 aircraft family. It was introduced by Boeing in 1997 as a shorter and more fuel-efficient version of the 737-800, typically seating between 110 and 149 passengers (depending on the configuration), and offering up to 2,950nm of range. Commonly used by airlines for short to medium-haul flights, it's known for its reliability and cost-effectiveness. â Images are courtesy of ZachJaneway. Thereâs no information regarding the arrival of the -600 and -800 models to the marketplace yet, but Threshold will keep you updated! â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MLD Scenery has recently released their rendition of Iasi International Airport (LRIA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth-busiest airport in Romania with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers (pre-pandemic).  As one of the oldest accredited airports in Romania, its history dates back to almost 100 years ago (1926), when it first became a commercial airport with scheduled flights, operated by CFRNA (Compagnie Franco-Roumaine de Navigation AÃ©rienne). Almost 30 years later, it got a new runway, a modern lighting system, and a passenger terminal followed in 1969, with another upgrade in 2001 to separate domestic and international flights.  A brand new terminal (T2) was built in 2012, increasing its passenger capacity and specially designated for Schengen and domestic flights. A long-term, multi-stage upgrade program started the year after, including a new runway (finished in 2014), a new terminal building (inaugurated in 2015), and an apron extension (completed in 2021).  In early 2022, the managers signed a â¬66 million contract with an Austrian construction company to design and build a new terminal (T4) and extend the parking lot, increasing the airportâs capacity to 3.3 million passengers yearly. The estimated completion date is sometime in December 2023.  The scenery features a high-fidelity rendition of the airport, with an updated layout (as of 2022), custom ground polygons, custom approach and taxi lights, custom night lighting, parallax windows, and photorealistic textures on the airport buildings. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.16, requiring at least 1.62 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently released an update (v3.00.0060) to their 737 Lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator, adding MMRs (multi-mode radios), minor fixes, and changes to the ground handling behavior.Â   In theÂ update announcement post, Robert Randazzo states the update is mostly âfoundationalâ with most of it being stripped out of the changelog due to it being internal and focusing on âpreparing the groundâ for future equipment additions such as the upcoming EFB.  The highlights include the addition of Multi-Mode Radios and the tweaks to the ground handling qualities of the airplane, switching from PMDGâs own internal algorithms to Asoboâs, claimed to be better than before and with the promise of further tweaks to bring a realistic Boeing steering experience. The complete changelog follows down below:  0012223: [Pedestal - Radios/Comms/Navs]introduction of MMRs (GLS functionality pending) (abashkatov) 0012251: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Black texture on all VC's (vscimone) 0012210: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Captain Footrest adjustment (vscimone) 0012253: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Texture clipping on NAV 2 panel (vscimone) 0012228: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Comm 2 strange texture (abashkatov) 0012173: [Virtual Cockpit - Functionality/Click-Spots] F/O PREV PAGE button not animating (vscimone) 0012211: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Right Air outlet needs adjustment (vscimone) 0012198: [External Model - Geometry] Light bleeding through front cabin walls (jbrown) 0012199: [External Model - Geometry] Hole in front of passenger cabin (jbrown) 0012150: [FMS - Performance Pages] Consistent use of custom payload ZFW value (emvaos) 0012190: [General - Ground Operations] Stairs 1L Arrive Even if JTWY INH (hvanrensburg) 0012175: [FMS - Setup/Options Pages] EFIS/MAP Options still greyed out (hvanrensburg) 0012180: [External Model - Liveries] Texture Alignment Between Fuse2 - Fuse3 Left Side (jbrown) 0012176: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Black texture on top of glareshield (vscimone) 0012226: [Virtual Cockpit - Functionality/Click-Spots] Switches with PMDG Mouse option (hvanrensburg)â â The 737-900 variant is out of the testing phase, undergoing work on the last-minute details for the impending release.Â   The Universal Flight Tablet is still being worked on, with a WASM/communication issue depending on input from Asobo to find out whether itâs on their end or a platform problem.  The upcoming DC-6 update is waiting on a platform update before it can be released, and the 777 is still being worked on but with nothing to show for the time being.  The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Pictures are courtesy of Pineapple_Wizard.

    <title>Orbx Releases Helipads LA Police for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released a set of LAPD helipads in downtown Los Angeles for Microsoft Flight Simulator, part of their Police Activities Expansion Pack aimed at city-building simulation professionals.Â   The pack features a highly detailed model of the LAPD Heliport, the LAPD headquarters, the LA County Jail, and many Sheriffâs department helipads scattered around the LA basin area. Itâs said to offer a unique and realistic look into the daily operations of the police forces in a Major urban area.  TheÂ Los Angeles Police Department heliportÂ is a helicopter landing facility in Los Angeles, established in the 1970s as a way for the LAPD to have quick access to the cityâs airspace for various policing needs, such as the pursuit of suspects and surveillance. The heliport is also used for training and administrative purposes. Over the years, the LAPD has acquired a fleet of helicopters for use at the heliport, Â including the Bell 206 JetRanger, the Airbus H125, and the Airbus AS350. The heliport has become an important part of the LAPDâs policing efforts and is considered one of the busiest law enforcement heliports in the United States.  TheÂ new Los Angeles Police Department headquartersÂ is a state-of-the-art facility located in downtown Los Angeles, California. The building was conceived to be environmentally friendly and sustainable, featuring energy-efficient systems and materials. The new headquarters will be a 12-story building with approximately 602,000 square feet, comporting around 1,200 employees, including offices, training rooms, a fitness center, a secure parking structure, and a rooftop terrace. It replaces the old Parker Center, demolished in 2018.  TheÂ Los Angeles County JailÂ is a complex of several facilities located in LA. Itâs the largest jail system in the United States, with an average daily population of around 18,000 inmates. It's operated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and is responsible for the incarceration of individuals who have been arrested or awaiting trial. The jail facilities range from maximum to minimum security and include the Menâs Central Jail, the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, and the Inmate Reception Center. The jail system has been the subject of criticism in the past for issues such as overcrowding, inadequate medical care, and mistreatment of inmates. In recent years, the Department has implemented several reforms addressing these issues, including reducing the jail population, improving conditions for inmates, and increasing transparency and accountability.  Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $10.18, requiring at least 1.71 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>GearDown Simulations Previews Campo dos Amarais Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/gdscaa" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/63d3d85d2f64d3db09fb342d_campo.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="3280059"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations has recently previewed the progress on their rendition of Campo dos Amarais - Prefeito Francisco Amaral State Airport (SDAM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a general aviation airport serving Campinas, the fourteenth most populous city in Brazil.  Despite not having scheduled flights throughout the year, the traffic figures sit at nearly 40 thousand passengers a year, all of that being general aviation, divided between executive jets, air taxis, and student pilots. With a total of 25 hangars and compatibility with nocturnal operations, itâs the ideal business alternative to Viracopos, the main airport in the region. Itâs operated by Rede Voa, a private Brazilian airports consortium responsible for sixteen airports scattered around the country. They won the concession to Campo dos Amarais and four airports in the SÃ£o Paulo state back in March 2017, when the previous owner, DAESP (the Airways Department of SÃ£o Paulo State), had to give up on most of their airports due to financial problems.  Developed in close contact with the operator (Rede Voa), the scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with an 85% accurate mesh, custom ground textures, custom vegetation, and more.  Thereâs no information regarding the release date or pricing, but Threshold will keep you updated! â</summary>
