    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Ponta Delgada - JoÃ£o Paulo II Airport (LPPD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the municipality of Ponta Delgada in the Archipelago of the Azores with a yearly average of 2 million passengers.  The airport's construction started in 1963, with the official inauguration only happening six years later in 1969 by President AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s. Its primary purpose was serving inter-island connections and Europe, with regular flights to Lisbon beginning a year later.  A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1995 when the airport also got its current name after the Pope's visit to the Azores four years prior.  The following decade post-new terminal brought massive growth in passenger traffic, which has been steadily growing, connecting the Azores to the world.  Azores Airlines, Binter Canarias, British Airways, Edelweiss Air, Iberia, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SATA Air AÃ§ores, Smartwings, Swiss, TAP, Transavia, TUI fly Belgium, TUI fly Netherlands, and United Airlines all serve it, with most of them only offering their services during summer. It's also the most important cargo airport in the archipelago, handling over 10,000 tonnes yearly.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, hand-made textures, custom POIs, true-to-life landside recreation, a detailed terminal interior, an official GSX profile, and more.  It's available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.55, requiring at least 3.06 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently released their biggest update so far for their A320 add-on, adding a new display rendering method, new pax layout, flight model improvements, and more.  According to the developers in aÂ development updateÂ published earlier today, the update almost got delayed due to a game-breaking issue, which they managed to fix after three days of extensive testing.  Update v1.5.1.193 will bring substantial changes to the aircraft, easily noticeable through the hefty changelog with multiple fixes and additions. The highlights of V2 Block 1 are the new displays, performance improvements (which we have previously covered and shown some of their benchmarks), and a new flight model, with tweaks to the airplaneâs behavior on multiple stages of the flight. The changelog follows down below: â V2 Block 1 A320 CFM V1.5.1.193 [APP] [EFB] [DISPLAYS] [FM, FBW &amp; AUTOFLIGHT] [AVIONICS &amp; SYSTEMS] [VISUALS] [SOUND] [KNOWN ISSUES] â  The developers also warned about the fact that the aircraft is transitioning from a nine-month release to a completely different build tested by their internal circle of testers, reinstating that even though they have tested it a lot, oddities could happen on various hardware configurations.  The second part of the V2 update - Block 2 - is set to release next month, bringing an improved 3D model, a new engine option, and tweaks to some of the systems.Â  The add-on is available on theÂ Fenix SimulationsÂ store for roughly $63.65.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly X Simulations has recently released their rendition of Teesside International Airport (EGNV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving North East England with a yearly average of 200,000 passengers.  It started as an RAF airfield in 1941, housing the RAF and the Royal Canadian Air Force during WW2.Â   Twenty years later, the airfield was developed into a civil airport named Tees-Side Airport. Many airlines served it during its first decade, including British Midland, BKS Air Transport, Dan-Air, Autair, and Channel Airways.Â   The 1970s were particularly rough for Teesside regarding scheduled services, with holiday flights becoming its primary source of passenger traffic through the wings of Northeast Airlines, Britannia Airways, Aviaco, Spantax, and Aviogenex. Â  Privatization came in 1987, with local authorities retaining their shares and the airport getting its current name: Teesside International Airport.  The airport was heavily upgraded in 2017 after a troublesome decade post-2008 crisis leading to a massive drop in passenger traffic figures leading to many airlines abandoning it for other nearby airports.Â   The renewal and subsequent takeover in 2018 brought back a lot of traffic, and the figures have been rising ever since.  BH Air, Eastern Airways, KLM, Loganair, Ryanair, and TUI Airways currently serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR texturing, custom orthophoto for the airport and surroundings, custom terminal interior, custom ground textures, high-resolution textures, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $15.25, requiring at least 2.76 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. German flight sim developer Aerosoft is planning to develop an Airbus A321neo alongside the previously announced A330neo for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â  â According to a post on the website of the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Aerosoft has received â¬459,000 from a grant to partially fund their development of the âAirbusNEO seriesâ, which includes the A330neo and A321neo.Â  â â The grant was set up by the German government in 2019 to help boost the games sector within Germany, and to make Germany a hub for game development in Europe. The German government has provided up to â¬50 million each year in grants, and has funded over 400 different video game projects. â Currently, Aerosoft has been hard at work on their highly anticipated A330ceo project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which has come under new management after their previous product manager of more than twenty years, Mathijs Kok, left Aerosoft for the PMDG team. As of the time of writing, Kokâs new position at PMDG has not been revealed to the public yet.As for the A321neo and A330neo, there are a lot of unknowns about their respective projects. The posting on the website says that, âNumerous functions, animations and sound effects are to be developed using state-of-the-art tools that have not yet been implemented in Microsoft Flight Simulatorâ, suggesting that the complexity of these two aircraft will be something unlike their previous work in MSFS. We do not know when an intended release date would be, which aircraft will be released first, or if Aerosoft plans on releasing them as a bundle, as suggested by the post.Â  â At this point in time, much about both aircraft are up to speculation, but what we do know for certain is that they are planned, and they are coming in the near future.Threshold will keep you updated on all the developments regarding the upcoming Aerosoft airliners, so stay tuned! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Matt Wagner was recently Interviewed on 'The Mover and Gonky Show'. This was a two hour long video which included a DCS World Q&amp;A. There are some interesting points made in the video so IÂ encourage you to watch the video aswell.  A Broader Scope:The grand vision is to have a battlefield where ground units can operate seamlessly alongside helicopters and jets. This would mean an immersive experience where users could transition between different theaters of war, each detailed and realistic. â Ground Movement Animation:One of the focal areas for the Eagle Dynamics team currently is the ground movement for infantry. The older animations have stood the test of time but are now due for a refresh. An updated animation is in the works, promising more fluid and realistic movements, in sync with the advancements in game development technology. â New Additions and Updates:While some might be disappointed about the absence of Ukraine and Taiwan maps due to their sensitive nature, the future holds promise: Media Influence:The recent release of Top Gun 2 has spurred an interest in DCS modules. The movie's success resulted in a surge of sales for DCS modules, prompting Eagle Dynamics to release the special 'Be a Maverick' pack, which bundled the F-14, F/A-18, and Supercarrier. â Challenges and Solutions:It's not just about adding new content, but also about refining existing modules: â Potential Future Additions:Questions have arisen regarding the addition of certain aircraft like the SAAB Gripen or the Rafael. The challenge in adding 4+ gen aircraft is the acquisition of necessary resources. However, with partnerships and introductions, nothing is off the table. There's even been talk about the Flanker being introduced as a full-fidelity DCS module, though data acquisition remains a significant hurdle. â</summary>

Brazil Land Games has recently announced the development of Uberaba - MÃ¡rio de Almeida Franco Airport (SBUR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Uberaba in Minas Gerais, Brazil, with a yearly average of 104,856 passengers. â The airport was built in the 1930s, with its commercial debut in April 1934: a VASP flight on a Monospar ST4 from SÃ£o Paulo, with a single stop in RibeirÃ£o Preto. During its first decades of operation, it was only an airfield.  â A passenger terminal was only built in 1950, and promotion to airport status only came in 1958 after it was donated from the city to the government (the now defunct Ministry of Aviation).  â Infraero (a state-controlled airport administration company) took control in 1980, investing heavily in modernization and bringing it up to the expected standard of a commercial airport in Brazil: night lighting, a meteorological station, and an eventual terminal expansion many years later in 2008, doubling its passenger handling capabilities. â It was recently purchased by Aena, granting them 30 years of administrative rights over the airport and the obligation of modernizing it within five years of taking control (by 2027, at the very least).  â â The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a detailed terminal interior, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. â Thereâs no release date or price information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed. â</summary>

    <title>AflOSim Releases Sofia Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/64dd11757ace5260f080195a_sof1.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="984183"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. AflOSim has recently released their rendition of Sofia Airport (LBSF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the capital city of Sofia in Bulgaria with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  The airport was built after a decree from Tsar Boris III in 1937 authorizing the construction on land within the village of Vrazhdebna. It was inaugurated two years later with its first passenger terminal.Â   After a brief period of military exclusivity during World War 2, it was returned to the city in 1947 with a new passenger terminal designed by Ivan Marangozov.Â   In the 1960s, said terminal was already at capacity, with extension work starting in 1968 to counter that issue. From a measly 600,000 passengers in the 60s, the airport was handling around 3 million passengers by the late 1970s.Â   With the numbers constantly growing, they started planning a new expansion in the 1990s, which comprehended the construction of Terminal 2. It was formally opened in 2006, after a 200 million euros investment from the European Investment Bank and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.Â   Terminal 1 serves low-cost carriers such as WizzAir, easyJet, and European Air. Terminal 2 handles the âfancyâ carriers with seven air bridges, 50,000 square meters of total area, 38 check-in desks, and a car park for 820 vehicles.  Aegean Airlines, Air Cairo, Air Serbia, Austrian Airlines, BH Air, British Airways, Bulgaria Air, Corendon Airlines, easyJet, EI AI, European Air Charter, flydubai, GullivAir, ITA Airways, Jet2.com, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Pegasus Airlines, Qatar Airways, Ryanair, Sky Express, SkyUp, Sun Express, Swiss International Air Lines, TAROM, TUI Airways, Turkish Airlines, Windrose Airlines, and WizzAir serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, moving jetways, animated people, custom ground textures, custom night lighting, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.27, requiring at least 621.71 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
