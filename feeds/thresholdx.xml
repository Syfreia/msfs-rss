    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published theÂ second development updateÂ of this month, with information on future 737 updates, console liveries, new marketplace arrivals, UFT, 777, and more.  Randazzo begins with information on the 737 Lineup updates for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which have been sent to the beta team, including changes to prepare the aircraft for the Universal Flight Tablet.Â   The Xbox liveries for the 737 are going through marketplace intake and should be made available soon. They are still exploring manners to minimize user costs for liveries.  They have also begun pushing the 737-600 and 737-900 to the Marketplace along with their liveries, with their prediction pointing to an end of July release.  The Universal Flight Tablet is being moved into its final leg of testing. It has been tested on a single airframe so far (the 737-700) to minimize developmental hassles. No previews are available yet.  The 777 has progressed significantly since FSExpo, with PMDG looking into previewing it soon.Â   They finish with a quick note on the DC-6, which should be getting an update in August.  Their product lineup for MSFS is available on theirÂ websiteÂ and in the Marketplace, although only partially. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A2A Simulations has recently released their first airplane for Microsoft Flight Simulator: the Accu-Sim Comanche, based on a real Piper Comanche 250 they have owned and operated for a decade. The first of the Comanches, the PA-24, had its prototype built in 1956, sporting a semi-monocoque construction with retractable landing gear and powered by a 180 hp Lycoming engine. Production started a year later and continued until 1972, ended by a flood that compromised the entire production line beyond recovery. The Comanche 250, the one A2A simulates, came two years after the 180hp variant, with a 250 hp engine (hence the 250). Early models had manually operated flaps and up to 230L of fuel. At the same time, future units (post-1961) could carry up to 340L total on auxiliary tanks, and electrically actuated flaps were made standard in 1962.  A2Aâs rendition is their first AccuSim 2.0 product, which is a culmination of years of experience with aircraft simulation, featuring a brand new aerodynamics system that accurately models how an airplane flies through the air. The aircraft features the aforementioned aerodynamics system, accurate engine performance based on their own Comanche 250, realistic handling characteristics and trim behavior, a physics-based per-cylinder simulation of the engine, dynamic ground physics, an advanced turbulence system, airframe vibration physics, authentic fuel simulation, a custom oil system with dynamic viscosity, advanced engine starter simulation, a physics-driven sound environment, a detailed JPI EDM 830 engine monitor, custom-coded Narco avionics, further integration options for third-party GPSs, and much more. The complete feature list follows down below: Itâs available at the A2A Simulations Store for $49.99.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Rfscenerybuilding Releases Abruzzo Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Rfscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Abruzzo Airport (LIBP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Pescara, Italy, with a yearly average of 700,000 passengers.  It was built in 1917 by the Regio Esercito (Royal Italian Army), initially with their fleet of two Farman 14s. A year later, it hosted the 302Â° Squadron and their Ansaldo SVA Biplanes, among the best fighter bombers of the time.  After World War I, it was renamed Pasquale Liberi after a local aviator. Then, in 1927 it was expanded to 50 hectares and modernized.  With the advent of commercial aviation in the 1930s, Abruzzo was served by SocietÃ  Area Mediterranea (SAM) with a tri-weekly service from Pescara to Rome Urbe Airport with a single stop.  World War 2 stopped commercial aviation in Pescara, which only resumed two years after the war with Transadriatica and their Douglas DC-3s. Avio Linee Italiane soon joined with a route between Milan to Brindisi, with stops in Pescara, Foggia, and Bari. â Most commercial operations were suspended in 1979 after a revision of the minimum landing requirements by the ANPAC, a national association of civil aviation pilots. Pescara did not have the required ILS instruments, which made airlines like Itavia shy away from operating at the airport.Â   Things only improved in the early 1980s, after the arrival of Aermediterranea, a little airline controlled by Alitalia, and eventually Aero Transporti Italiani in 1984, also controlled by Alitalia.Â   The current terminal was opened in 1996, and the old building was reutilized for logistical and technical support. That terminal underwent multiple improvements between 2008 and 2018, including its expansion, modernization, and renovation, costing 33 million euros.  Itâs currently served by ITA Airways (Milano Linate), Luxair (Luxembourg), Ryanair (Bergamo, BucharestâOtopeni, Catania, Charleroi, LondonâStansted, Turin), and Wizz Air (Tirana).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom ground service equipment, custom night lighting, realistic windows, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.28, requiring at least 72.82 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimulaciÃ³n Extrema has recently released their rendition of Presidente PerÃ³n International Airport (SAZN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of NeuquÃ©n, Cipolletti, Plottier, Centenario, and General Roca, in Argentina, with a yearly average of 800,000 passengers.  The airport was built in 1936 as Aero Club NeuquÃ©n, with a single gravel runway. Its paving and modernization only happened in 1951, when Argentina planned to pioneer air transport in Latin America.Â   Eight years later, the surrounding terrain was expropriated so they could build an International Airport with a longer runway, a proper passenger terminal, and proper general infrastructure.  The airport was renovated in 2013 and expanded in 2019, with the construction of a domestic and international pre-boarding area, with 1500 square meters for the first one and 630 for the latter. They have also built a new security area, two commercial lots with 80 square meters each, bathrooms totaling up to 140 square meters, and 18 check-in gates.  AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Flybondi, JetSmart Argentina, American Jet, LADE, and Latam Argentina currently serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom jetways, custom ground textures, 4K PBR textures, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.60, requiring at least 957.13 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Pyreegue Dev Co. has recently released their rendition of East Midlands Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator (EGNX), serving the entire East Midlands region with a yearly average of 3 million passengers.  The airport started as RAF Castle Donington in 1943, sporting three concrete runways and two hangars, and it hosted the 28 Operational Training Unit and the 108 Operational Training Unit during the short WW2 stint. It was closed and decommissioned three years later, in 1946.  Then, in 1964, a group of local government agencies bought the former airfield, investing heavily in transforming it into a commercial airport. It was then renamed East Midlands Airport and got ready for passenger traffic in early 1965.  The airport saw heavy upgrade work in the early 2000s when the traffic figures increased significantly. It included an extension of the passenger terminal, new car parks, and a new pier.  Itâs an important cargo hub for DHL and UPS, which collaborate significantly to its second position in cargo traffic in the UK.  Airline-wise, itâs mostly an LCC airport, with the likes of Jet2.com (Alicante, Antalya, Faro, Fuerteventura, Funchal, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, MÃ¡laga, TenerifeâSouth), TUI (Alicante, Hurghada, Lanzarote, MÃ¡laga, Sharm El Sheikh, TenerifeâSouth), and Ryanair (Alicante, Barcelona, BelfastâInternational, Bergamo, Berlin, Budapest, Cork, Dublin, Faro, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Knock, KrakÃ³w, Lanzarote, Limoges, MÃ¡laga, Malta, Riga, RomeâCiampino, RzeszÃ³w, TenerifeâSouth, WrocÅaw).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with LiDAR elevation data, up-to-date satellite imagery, custom ground polygons with accurate weathering, an up-to-date airport layout, ATC/AI traffic integration, animated Skylink buses, dynamic gate doors (GSX is required), a custom GSX profile, a custom terminal interior, landside buildings, and more.  Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $22, requiring at least 3.56 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SamScene has recently released their rendition of Jeju International Airport (RKPC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in South Korea with a yearly average of 31 million passengers.  The airport was built as a military airfield in 1946 and only converted to civilian use in 1963. The first international flight to Osaka, Japan, only happened a year later.  In the early 90s, due to the constantly rising passenger volume, the government decided to build a much larger terminal, reaching completion in 1997. It has been one of the busiest airports in the country ever since.  Jeju International Airport is a major hub for Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, and it also serves many other airlines, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, EVA Air, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways.  The airport is currently operating at its capacity, so they are constructing a new one near the city of Seogwipo, expected to reach completion by 2025.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed terminal interior, custom night lighting, a detailed city center, iconic points of interest, custom ground markings, custom jetways, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.45, requiring at least 1.33 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. WingSim has recently released their rendition of El AlcaravÃ¡n Airport (SKYP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Yopal, Colombia.  It was built in the 1960s to serve the oil industry in the state, with Aerotaxi Casanare S/A handling most of the passenger traffic.Â   In the late 90s, petrol companies worldwide gathered together to improve the airportâs conditions so it could accommodate larger aircraft. The president landed with a Boeing 707 to inaugurate the improvements in late 1996.  Ten years later, the Camera de Comercio de Casanare (their Chamber of Commerce) asked the Ministry of Transport to make it an international airport, which was only granted many years later. Despite being classified as an international airport and having an immigration facility, it has no international flights.  Itâs currently served by Avianca, EasyFly, Latam Colombia, and Satena, with flights to BogotÃ¡ and Bucaramanga.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom night lighting, a terminal interior, hangars, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MSK Productions has recently released their rendition of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (VABB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Mumbai Metropolitan Region with a yearly average of 43 million passengers.  The airport started as a Royal Air Force airfield in the 1930s, housing multiple RAF squadrons during WW2, and was eventually handed over to the government to be converted into a civilian airport once the conflict had ceased.  The first expansion started in the 50s, with further work planned in the 60s but only executed in the late 70s, causing a lot of drama back then. Time magazine said the terminal was a âblack holeâ of sorts, and then a terminal building fire killed three passengers in 1979. It was overcrowded and unsafe.  The new terminal reached completion in 1980, costing 110 million rupees and temporarily solving the overcrowding. It was then modernized in the early 2000s, bringing it up to international standards.  It is currently the second busiest airport in India, after Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. Several airlines serve it, including Air India, IndiGo, Jet Airways, and SpiceJet.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, custom buildings, dynamic lighting, animated jetways, terminal 1 and 2 interiors, custom terraforming, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $22.23, requiring at least 380.25 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
