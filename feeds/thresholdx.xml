    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly 2 High has recently released their rendition of Cheongju International Airport (RKTU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of Cheongwon-Ku, Daejeon, and Sejong with an yearly average of 2 million passengers. It was built as a military airbase in 1978, with the international airport plan to begin construction in 1984 and its eventual conclusion in December 1996, opening in April 1997.  Back in the 80s, Cheongju was selected as a potential construction site for Koreaâs main international airport, but Incheon ended up being the chosen one.  The airport was built to handle the current yearly traffic (2 million people) and 196 thousand airplane operations, along with a parking lot big enough for 770 cars. It also happens to house a fighter wing of the Korean Air Force, which means taking photographs of the apron, runways, and the military facilities is strictly prohibited. Itâs served by nine airlines, with a selection of domestic routes and international legs to China, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. Aero K and Asiana fly from Cheongju to Jeju, Bamboo Airways operates a seasonal leg to Quy Nhon, Jeju Air flies to Guam, Jeju, Osaka-Kansai, and Taipei-Taoyuan, Jin Air and Korean Air fly to Jeju, Sky Angkor Airlines operates a seasonal hop to Siem Reap, Tâway Air flies to Da Nang, and Yakutia Airlines operates two seasonal journeys to Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The scenery features an accurate rendition of RKTU, with custom jetways, dynamic lighting, PBR materials, animated humans, and performance friendly optimization. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $12.75, requiring at least 2 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently updated their 737 Lineup to version 3.00.0056, reducing code execution latency, virtual cockpit model improvements to improve rendering efficiency, fixing the parking brake lever lock switch keybind, and improved data display on the in-game HUD.  Regarding the 737-900, they have pushed a new beta build to the testers for data collection. Itâs still being âtidied upâ with an eventual release getting closer, although they reinforced it wonât be before 2023, as work continues on a broad array of features.  The PMDG Universal Flight Tablet will be added to the -900 testing program by next week, putting them in a good position to begin rolling out the first functions for the EFB. They plan to release one function at a time to not overload the beta testing team, aiming for an eventual continual update process that should cover the entire fleet of existing and upcoming aircraft. They also stated the tablet will be updated separately from the aircraft update channel, meaning it might evolve independently and faster than the airplane updates.  The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Images are courtesy of Genista.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. JustSim has recently released their rendition of Girona-Costa Brava Airport (LEGE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Girona in north-eastern Catalonia. It averages around 2 million passengers per year, peaking during the summer when nine european airlines (Brussels Airlines, Enter Air, Jet2.com, LOT Polish Airlines, Ryanair, Smartwings, Transavia, TUI Airways, and TUI Fly Belgium) add the city to their destination list. The Irish low-cost carrier is the only one to maintain a fixed schedule throughout the year, although fairly limited (KrakÃ³w, London Stansted, Nuremberg, and Pisa).  Built in 1965, Girona had modest traffic figures up until the early 2000s, when Ryanair chose it as their âBarcelonaâ due to its proximity with the Catalan Capital, and cheaper landing fees and operating costs. The airport saw an increase from mere 275,000 passengers in 1993 to over 5 million during the âRyanair eraâ which ended in 2012 when they decided to move the operations to El Prat. Traffic figures got halved a year after, and it has been consistently around that ballpark ever since. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport and its facilities, with custom ground textures, landside buildings, custom clutter, and updated taxiways. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $9.06 (with a discount for owners of the P3D/XP11 version), requiring at least 1.67 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

The second place, Belfast International Airport, sits at just a fraction of that amount with 6 million passengers. It is the hub for Aer Lingus, Irelandâs national carrier, with an extensive route network encompassing North America and Europe. It also hosts Ryanair, one of the largest low-cost carriers in the world, featuring a significant domestic and intra-European network.  MK Studiosâ first iteration of Dublin Airport came out in November 2020, one of the first payware airports for the then brand new simulator, featuring a fully detailed rendition of the airport, with updated ground layout and stands (not anymore), a terminal interior model, AI compatibility, and performance-friendly optimization. Itâs still available onÂ SimMarketÂ andÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $10. Owners will be eligible for a discounted price once V2 is available.Â   There is no information on the release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you updated! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Colimata has recently released the third version of their Concorde add-on, especially for X-Plane 12 (not compatible with X-Plane 11). Itâs said to bring their product to a new level in terms of visuals, flight model, and functionality.Â   The Concorde was a supersonic passenger airplane operated by British Airways and Air France between 1976 and 2003. It was developed in the 1960s as a joint venture between the British and French governments, making its first flight in 1969. It was known for its sleek, delta-wing design and the ability to fly at speeds of up to Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound (it was the first commercial airplane to break the sound barrier and could fly from London to New York in just over three hours). Despite its short service life, the Concorde remains an iconic and influential aircraft in aviation history.  The Colimata Concorde is a highly detailed and realistic aircraft simulation for X-Plane 12, featuring a 3D cockpit with front, center, roof, side and engineering panels. The cockpit features 4K texturing and over 1000 click regions, as well as 700+ custom lights for warning lamps, night lighting, and exterior lights. The aircraft also includes a PRO or STANDARD complexity setting. The external model is equally detailed, with accurate 3D modeling, moving engine parts, and opening doors and service panels. The flight model offers realistic takeoff and landing behavior, and refined subsonic and supersonic flight. The sound design is immersive, with 3D audio and a wide variety of sound effects. Itâs fully VR-compatible and includes an autopilot with 16+ functions. The complete feature list follows down below: â 3D COCKPIT EXTERNAL MODEL Â  FLIGHTMODEL Â  SOUND Â  VR Â  IN ADDITION Â  Â  MANUALS â  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $54.95 (on sale), requiring at least 600 MB of free disk space. Owners of the previous version are eligible for an upgrade discount. Shout out to PrivatePilot on our Discord for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Pyreegue has recently published aÂ roadmapÂ for 2023 with their many plans for the new year, including a couple of preview images of his upcoming East Midlands Airport (EGNX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, developed with âincredible attention to detailâ and featuring ânumerous exciting features.â Heâs also announced an eventual update to his Edinburgh Airport (EGPH) with ânew models, textures, mesh, custom satellite imagery, and more.â The preview images show the control tower and the Rolls Royce Hangar, built by RPS Group and designed to accommodate separate heritage and corporate hangars.Â  â The hangars are connected by a central spine and feature a dedicated maintenance and workshop space for each one. Additionally, there is a shared area for conferences, offices, a seminar space, a library, crew and locker rooms, and restrooms. The design even had children and students in mind with a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) facility where they could attend training events and seminars. The project (the real-life counterpart) was developed in close contact with Rolls Royce, with all their requirements in mind, from the concept to the space planning and detail design. â  East Midlands Airport is located in Leicestershire, England, and serves the East Midlands region of the country, including the cities of Derby, Leicester, and Nottingham. It is the largest cargo airport in the UK and the seventh busiest airport in terms of passenger numbers. In 2020, the airport handled around 5 million passengers and over 200,000 tonnes of cargo.Â   It has a single terminal and serves a variety of airlines, including budget carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet, as well as traditional carriers like British Airways and KLM. The airport has a diverse route network, with direct flights to destinations across Europe and some long-haul destinations in the Middle East and the Caribbean. Domestically, the airport has good connectivity to major cities in the UK, including London, Manchester, and Glasgow.  â Facility-wise, it has a range of amenities for passengers, including a range of shops and restaurants, as well as lounges and a business center. The airport also has good transport links, with a railway station located within the terminal building and regular bus and coach services to nearby cities and towns. In recent years, the airport has undergone several expansion projects to improve its capacity and facilities, and it is well-regarded as a modern and efficient airport.  Thereâs no information regarding the release date or pricing yet, but weâll keep you informed once thereâs new intel. Shout out to Luke on our Discord for the news scoop! â</summary>
