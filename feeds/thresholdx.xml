    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Flight Sim Association has announced the dates and location of FlightSimExpo 2023! The event is one of the world's largest dedicated flight simulation conferences. Since 2018, over 3,500 attendees have attended Las Vegas, Orlando, and San Diego events. Similar to 2021, the event will be held in a hybrid online and in-person setting.Â  We are happy to announce that the venue and location for FSExpo 2023 is the Lone Star Flight Museum at Ellington Airport (EFD) in Houston, Texas! According to FSA, "the 130,000 square foot museum and learning center has ample space for more than 2,000 attendees across two air-conditioned hangars." Other facilities surrounding the area are the Texas Aviation Hall of Fame and learning exhibits that include Redbird flight training devices. FSExpo 2023 will be held from June 23rd to June 25th, with the 23rd being an "add-on series of group discussions" before the in-person conference on June 24th and 25th.Â  Ellington Airport is approximately 15 minutes drive away from Hobby Airport (HOU) and 35 minutes from Intercontinental (IAH). FSA's Evan Reiter writes that the venue is working with hotels, airlines, and rental car companies to secure discounted rates for attendees. They're also anticipating that attendees will be able to "add-on" experiences at NASA, ATC facilities, and more.Â  Registration for the event will begin in December. More information regarding hotels, attractions, and travel will be available later this year. Hopeful attendees of FSExpo can monitor their website to keep up to date with all new information regarding the upcoming event!</summary>

    <title>PMDG 737-700 for MSFS Updated, -600 Previewed</title>
    <updated>2022-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The youngest siblings of the 737 family have seen some limelight on the PMDG Forum today with group chief executive Robert Randazzo announcing the release of the productâs first update post-launch. A subsequent post published shortly after gives further insight into the next entry in the series, the 737-600. Firstly though, the changes list for the -700. Randazzo describes the foremost changes: â[The update] comes with a number of changes and improvements, including updated models and associated textures, a significant update to the sound engine and dozens upon dozens of small tweaks, adjustments and improvements.â Version 3.00.0020 of the PMDG 737-700 brings the following 69 changes: Updating the product can be done via the PMDG Operations Center. Randazzo notes that some may experience some sound issues on the first post-update run of the 737. âWe have traced this to the manner in which the sim caches sounds, and it can be easily corrected by simply running the airplane, then exiting back to the world menu and launching the aircraft a second time. For reasons we don't yet understand, the sim does not update the cache on the first run, but it does on the second launch and from then on you will be fine without further need to tinker.âÂ  Turning to the -600 variant of the 737, the âthoroughbredâ Baby Boeing is running approximately seven to nine days behind the schedule dictated by PMDG in the lead up to the first variantâs release.Â  Robert Randazzo maintains that due to some âslopâ accounted for in the release schedule, the -600 âmay still roll out on timeâ later this month, and that any delay on the little brother will not have any effect on the 737-800, slated for early August. The post then launches into detailing a number of new advancements coming both for the -600 and 737 series as a whole. âFor a few years now, we have been at work conducting a full rebuild on the lateral and vertical path modeling capability for the PMDG FMS used by all of our Boeing airliners.â âThe good news is that we are preparing to insert it into testing within the PMDG 737 for MSFS, and it will then roll out to you in the forum of a free update. This modern path modeling has been something we have been building toward for some time and it will dramatically improve the accuracy of how PMDG airliners move through the sky in a 3D pathway âConcurrent with the Lateral/Vertical Path Module we have been working to build out a proper flight director roll and pitch module based upon input from some of the industryâs leading flight control logic engineers and our in house mathematical wizard. âThis has been under initial iteration testing and will also roll out as a free update shortly.â On the topic of the Universal Flight Tablet, the team remains relatively tight-lipped on progress, with Randazzo suspecting that he may have given away too much information in last weekâs update. Today, he offers a few words to the effect of âsoonâ. Other miscellaneous topics covered include another reminder to customers of the 737 NGXu who purchased in November and December 2019 that a $99.99 credit remains available for their use on the PMDG webstore and that another update for the 737 will be due ânext weekâ.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Australian scenery-maker Orbx has today announced the forthcoming release of a landmarks pack based in their home city, Melbourne. The companyâs head office is located at Essendon Fields Airport, which they have also recreated in-sim. âWelcome to the cultural and sports capital of Australia and the hometown of Orbx! With about a third of its current five million residents born outside of Australia, Melbourneâs skyline mirrors its inhabitantsâ diversity, from Gold Rush and Victorian architecture to ultra-modern skyscrapers. Moreover, the city is home to Australiaâs second busiest airport, Tullamarine (YMML) and its busiest seaport.â âWhile World Update 7 Australia added photogrammetry to Melbourne and about a dozen Orbx-made POIs, this new Â Melbourne pack has another 200 custom-made buildings and structures, along with the many other enhancements and features our Landmarks series is known for.â The group have also added a number of animated features to the bustling city, including metro trains, hot air balloons and horses at two of Melbourneâs racecourses. The following feature list was provided: Check out World Update VII, which Orbx played a hand in creating, here.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Idahoâs Boise Air Terminal has now seen an entry in Microsoft Flight Simulator courtesy of Orbx, whoâve made the city's Gowen Field their latest release for the platform.Â  The airport serves a dual civilian/military purpose and is also home to the stateâs largest building â the control tower, which stands at a not-so-impressive 295ft or approximately 90 metres. Orbxâs rendition for the sim includes the following features: Boise is served by eight airlines in the current day, with a route network of 26 destinations. This is in stark contrast to its previous passenger-serving efforts, in which customers previously awaited their aircraft in what the developer describes as an âageing Varney Airlines (now United) hangarâ. The rather more modern, current terminal was opened in 2003. You can purchase Orbx Boise for $16.70 AUD (approx. US$12.04Â |Â â¬11,23Â |Â Â£9.64) from OrbxDirect.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Scenery-making subsidiary of development house iniBuilds, iniScene, has seen a busy last couple of months -- firstly with the release of Buffalo-Niagara (KBUF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator as well as the forthcoming release of San Antonio (KSAT) for the same platform. In a development update published today, the team have given some insight into the next steps moving forwards from three of their current projects. Ubaid Mussa, iniBuilds chief executive, addressed the groupâs London Heathrow rendition first. âTo start the year, in January we released our first mega-airportÂ iniScene London Heathrow EGLL for Microsoft Flight Simulator.â âThis was a fantastic project and we worked with some great people who engage with the airport daily to create a faithful rendition. Being our first mega-airport we learnt a lot, and as you can always expect from us, have reflected and are working on an update covering performance, night lighting and greater detail on road markings.â iniScene have opened a forum thread for users to share their wish-list for a free update to the product, which you can find here. Mussa confirms that iniScene London Heathrow will not be making its way to Prepar3D or X-Plane at this time. Turning their most recent release, Buffalo, the team express their thanks for great community reception to the product -- it is also now confirmed that work has started on the X-Plane 11 rendition of KBUF, which will see the light of day in further development updates. San Antonio is the final topic brought up in today's development update. Mussa acclaims iniScene's work as 'some of our best', and that KSAT will bring details 'not seen before in some of our other products'. "We plan to start release preparations for this airport very soon, and are working on the final details!" In addition to KSAT we are currently working on a few other projects which we will share more information on in the next couple of months along with a brand new product offering for you heli pilots. The CEO says a development update regarding iniBuilds' aircraft project will come in due course.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Airbus A330 will mark the third Microsoft Flight Simulator aircraft release for German developer Aerosoft, creators of one of the platforms' first complex products in the form of the CRJ series. Earlier this week, the development house provided new previews inside and out of Airbus' smallest widebody as well as some additional insight into various features. Aerosoft founder and spokesperson Mathijs Kok once again did the honours. He was careful to note that despite virtual cockpit 3D work being complete, the team is yet to add in decals and weathering -- essentially, these previews are not entirely representative of the final product. In a subsequent post on the same forum thread, Kok shares some new exterior previews too. When questioned by one community member about the apparent 'dumbing down' of Aerosoft's Twin Otter for the Xbox platform and whether this would be mirrored in the A330, Kok had this to say. "I do not know why you think that, the modelling and texturing were absolutely not dumbed down, was simple not needed. Nor will the A330 be. Both are optimized for Xbox use though, meaning they are fully done with MSFS technology. So not 8K textures but 2K with decals ending up with detail." A price has not been decided for Aerosoft's A330 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, nor a release date as yet.  You can find the original previews on the forum thread for the aircraft here.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Creators of Rotterdam-The Hague for Microsoft Flight Simulator, RDPresets have announced that Naplesâ airport will be their next pursuit for the platform.  With this news the developer doubles the number of projects theyâve got on the go, as work on Marseille continues concurrently. â[Marseille] has hit some major bumps in the road, some items failed our Quality Assurance and are requiring some remodelling, this will take time and has set Marseille back two release slots, meaning as it stands two other airports will come before it." The developer explains that the delay is necessary to ensure quality. "But this does allow me to announce you our first new airport which is in Italian [sic], âAeroporto di Napoliâ." "Weâre incredibly proud of how this product is currently being developed and itâs going at an incredible pace. Weâre using a new texture method ensuring a higher texture resolution, but at the same time using less texture sets. "It took us some time to perfect this and arguably weâre still learning it, but we feel it is really good already and worthy enough to put it above our current Rotterdam airport quality." RDPresets want to go 'the extra mile' in ground detailing with Naples, saying that the final product will 'truly give you an idea of arriving or departing [at an airport with proper weathering]. They have not offered a release date as yet, but maintain that the first in-sim images of Naples will debut shortly. It was also revealed in the development update that the brand is working on a hub software for their products. The software will be called RDHome.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The tail-dragging turboprop PC-6 Porter from Milviz will shortly see an update according to developers, who are currently working on 'stage 2' of the Pilatus craft. The aircraft was first released for Microsoft Flight Simulator in September 2021 in a typical land-faring configuration. Milviz's stage 2 is set add floats and tundra tyres to the available set-ups. An option for an older steam gauge cockpit with 'multiple radio options' will also be available according to the developer. Speaking to the status of the update, the team had this to say -- "Development is ongoing, but we are a bit behind schedule. Hope to have some pics with the floats in the coming weeks." Stage 2 of Milviz's PC-6 Porter will see a price rise for new customers, but existing users will be able to upgrade for free. The developer says that your initial purchase will entitle you to any future updates for this products. In the same Facebook post, the team also made brief mention of their latest release, the Cessna 310R. The twin piston craft's service pack is "nearly finished!"

Green River makes for a dramatic backdrop for bush flying, with large elevation changes, ridges, cliffs and pinnacles but to name a few prominent features. âMexican Mountain truly isâ¦out there, the views are tremendous, &amp; youâll have plenty of places to practice STOL landings nearby and youâre a short hop away from Moab.â Mexican Mountain will be available for free to owners of the FreedomFox Complete Package (incl. all Orbx customers) and will be available separately on the Microsoft Marketplace for $7.99 USD.Â  Starting with Mexican Mountain, previously released âscenesâ will also be migrated to the Marketplace so users without the FreedomFox Complete Package can use the strips too.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A few hours ago, Runway 26 Simulations has officially made their debut on Microsoft Flight Simulator with the announcement of their first product on the platform, Owen Roberts International Airport (MWCR). Shortly after the news drop, the team got it released on SimMarket. The real airport is the main international gateway for the Cayman Islands. Consisting of a single 2,398 runway with a recently upgraded terminal, the airport is home to the nationâs flag carrier, Cayman Airways and sees over 1 million passengers traversing through the airport. The airport is a major facilitator to Cayman Islandsâ reliance on imported goods, processing 1.5 million and a quarter of a million pounds of cargo and mail respectively. In a Facebook post briefly captioned âBehold... First scenery for MSFS2020â¦â The team also dropped a trailer on their YouTube channel, providing a quick walkthrough of the airport rendition. On the product page, thereâs not much in the way of information, with the notable omission of a basic feature list. We do know that it comes at a rather light 175MB package. The developer is recognised for its scenery creations focused around Central America, and the push into MSFS with the West Carribean airport is something to be expected. If youâre up for some scenic flying, you could begin your journey by exploring George Town. The airport, priced at 15 Euros - is an accessible ask. Presumably, this will mark the beginning of more caribbean airports to come, particularly from Runway 26, stay tuned as weâll keep you in the loop on future developments from the development team.</summary>

The update was quietly added to the Just Flight website today, with some of the main drawcards being a new fly-by-wire control system and re-done cockpit and instrument panels.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Being both Germanyâs busiest airport and Lufthansaâs primary hub, Flughafen Frankfurt is a large undertaking for any scenery developer, perhaps none less so than Aviotek Simulation Software, whom began on the airport in late 2020. Today, the group published the first in-simulator screenshots of EDDF, which will be coming to both X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator. It appears to be the former that the developer tackles first, as the images, posted on Facebook, come from Laminarâs sim. X-Plane has traditionally been the home of Aviotek, who have previously released five products for the platform via X-Aviation. âNow itâs time to fill the ramp with our pretty vehicles and equipment,â reads the social media post. âThere are still some improvements required, objects to be placed and bugs to fix, but the team is working day and night to deliver the best rendition possible for both the simulators, so you can really feel-there.â There is no release date or price that has been made available as yet. It is also not clear whether the Microsoft Flight Simulator rendition of Frankfurt will be available at the same time. You can find out more about Aviotekâs Frankfurt project in a previous article.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Boiseâs relatively small airfield makes headlines for the second time this week with another developer announcing theyâre bringing Gowen Field to Microsoft Flight Simulator. This time, the creator is Verticalsim. The scenery-maker has previously covered KBOI in X-Plane and in-line with previous releases, is now working on bringing their extensive catalogue of products for Laminarâs sim over to Microsoft Flight Simulator. Verticalsim published the following feature list with the announcement: Though a release date has not been mentioned, users likely wonât have to wait long for Boise to launch as based on previous releases Verticalsim tends to have a very short turnaround. Threshold will keep you posted.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Australian tourist destination Hamilton Island and its airport, YBHM, has received more attention today in the form of a new development update from AUscene. The airfield is one of two projects the developer currently has underway for Microsoft Flight Simulator. On release, Hamilton Island will move alongside the developerâs âReefworldâ area scenery covering the Great Barrier Reef. The two will be offered as a bundle pack due to their proximity. Todayâs development update focused on the terminalâs interior, which the developer initially debated whether to include at all. âAfter much consideration we decided to add the Terminal Interior and are excited to finally be able to share some previews with you all! Hamilton Island will be our most extensive product with plenty of details for you to discover at the Airport, Marina, Resort and Dent Island.â See the source post for this article on Facebook.</summary>
