    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlightSim Studio AG (in cooperation with X-Crafts) and AviationLads, have recently previewed the MCDU (Multi-Function Control and Display Unit) of the upcoming Embraer 175 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, showcasing a short route setup, performance initialization, and take-off data insertion. Itâs the fourth and last preview video, with the next one being the official trailer and its eventual release under an early access program.  Yesterday, X-Crafts made aÂ statementÂ on their partnership with FlightSim Studio AG in order to bring the Embraer 175 to MSFS, where they clarified both are different products, developed by different teams and with distinct objectives, with the only commonality between both product lines being the 3D model, which is the same. They have also reinforced their commitment to bring the E-Jets to X-Plane 11/12 at one point in 2023.  The E175 is part of the Embraer E-Jets family, seating 78 to 88 passengers in different cabin configurations, with a range of 1800 nautical miles on the standard variant. There are 12 operators around the World, with SkyWest being the largest (193 aircraft).Â   There is no information regarding the release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cowan Simulation has recently released their rendition of the Bell 206B3 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a popular variant of the 206 family whose production ended in 2010 (later variants were to cease production in 2017). It is their first helicopter for MSFS, after releasing eight different models for X-Plane.  The Bell 206 had its first flight in 1962, after winning a competition held by the United States Navy to develop a Light Observation Helicopter. Their D-250 design went on to become the YHO-4, where it failed to win the contract bid, and Bell found themselves trying to market it as a civil aircraft (Model 206). The first attempt didnât work well (terrible commercial success), but an eventual redesign aiming for a sleeker and aesthetic body made it a huge success. That one was launched as the Bell 206A JetRanger.Â   The first 206B JetRanger was introduced in 1971, with the 206B-3 coming in 1977 with a modified tail rotor, and improved engine. It got popular among TV channels for traffic and news reporting, armies, police departments, and private use.Â   The add-on features 4K PBR textures, realistic start up procedure, realistic flight dynamics, custom 3D instruments, virtual reality compatible, Wwise fully dynamic sound pack, detailed night lighting, and free future updates.Â   Itâs available for purchase onÂ CowanSimâs websiteÂ for $32.99, requiring at least 2 GB of free disk space to install.

    <title>PMDG Updates 737 Lineup for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-12-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently launched an update (3.00.0053) to their 737 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator, focusing on increasing the quality and performance of the product. The highlights of the update include further work on the aircraftâs stability and prevention of eventual disturbances caused by the simulatorâs exaggerated gusts, the addition of computationally derived stall angle of attack models for all wing configuration conditions on all of the three airplanes, reworked cabin collision models to allow native transition from cockpit to cabin, soundscape improvements (and expansion) in the cabin area, marked as a work in progress. The remainder of the changelog follows down below:  â Regarding the 737-900, Robert RandazzoâsÂ update announcement postÂ mentions good progress on the testing, with a few areas they intend to clean up before the release.Â   The Universal Flight Tablet is partially working but not quite ready yet due to the fact they plan to build an universal framework that allows the EFB to work across their entire aircraft lineup, including stuff that is yet to come like the 777, the 737 MAX, and the 747. Such universality takes development time, but itâs said to be coming soon.Â   The DC-6 update is waiting on an Asobo update for MSFS that has to do with the avionics, and when that is out, PMDG will be able to roll out theirs with a greater range of GPS options, improved trim and flight characteristics, and extra stability for the autopilot when tracking a course or an approach.Â   They claim to have âquite a bitâ going on behind the scenes, which will be revealed once the 737-900 and the EFB are out to the public. Â The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Images are courtesy of AllNaturalBlue.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly 2 High has recently released their rendition of Cheongju International Airport (RKTU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of Cheongwon-Ku, Daejeon, and Sejong with an yearly average of 2 million passengers. It was built as a military airbase in 1978, with the international airport plan to begin construction in 1984 and its eventual conclusion in December 1996, opening in April 1997.  Back in the 80s, Cheongju was selected as a potential construction site for Koreaâs main international airport, but Incheon ended up being the chosen one.  The airport was built to handle the current yearly traffic (2 million people) and 196 thousand airplane operations, along with a parking lot big enough for 770 cars. It also happens to house a fighter wing of the Korean Air Force, which means taking photographs of the apron, runways, and the military facilities is strictly prohibited. Itâs served by nine airlines, with a selection of domestic routes and international legs to China, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. Aero K and Asiana fly from Cheongju to Jeju, Bamboo Airways operates a seasonal leg to Quy Nhon, Jeju Air flies to Guam, Jeju, Osaka-Kansai, and Taipei-Taoyuan, Jin Air and Korean Air fly to Jeju, Sky Angkor Airlines operates a seasonal hop to Siem Reap, Tâway Air flies to Da Nang, and Yakutia Airlines operates two seasonal journeys to Khabarovsk and Vladivostok.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently updated their 737 Lineup to version 3.00.0056, reducing code execution latency, virtual cockpit model improvements to improve rendering efficiency, fixing the parking brake lever lock switch keybind, and improved data display on the in-game HUD.  Regarding the 737-900, they have pushed a new beta build to the testers for data collection. Itâs still being âtidied upâ with an eventual release getting closer, although they reinforced it wonât be before 2023, as work continues on a broad array of features.  The PMDG Universal Flight Tablet will be added to the -900 testing program by next week, putting them in a good position to begin rolling out the first functions for the EFB. They plan to release one function at a time to not overload the beta testing team, aiming for an eventual continual update process that should cover the entire fleet of existing and upcoming aircraft. They also stated the tablet will be updated separately from the aircraft update channel, meaning it might evolve independently and faster than the airplane updates.  The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Images are courtesy of Genista.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Henrik Nielsen, the creator of a popular freeware utility add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator, has released a major update for the product. The update, which brings the add-on to version 3.0, significantly improves the realism of the virtual world in the flight simulator by adding a wide variety of ships, boats, and ferries with realistic 3D models and authentic routes. One of the key features of the update is the addition of more than 400 new ship models from around the globe, including cruise ships, fishing boats, container ships, oil and gas tankers, and ferries. This brings the total number of unique ship models to almost 900, with a total of over 1,800 ships including repaints. The update also expands the coverage of ship routes, increasing traffic density in different regions. In addition to the new ship models, the update includes more than 100 new ferry routes and the ability to witness real-world naval exercises featuring ships from various countries. These exercises, which include full-scale NATO landing exercises on the West Coast of the Jutland Peninsula in Denmark and similar exercises by the Brazilian and Chinese navies in their respective areas, add a level of realism and immersion to the virtual world. Other features and improvements in the update include light, smoke, and wake effects on all ship models, as well as dynamic sounds for each type of ship model. The update is compatible with the latest sim update and has a minimal impact on performance, depending on the density of ship models in a given region. The download size is approximately 2.2 GB, with an installation size of 5.6 GB.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. SimSolutions, a leading aircraft design and development brand in the flight sim community, has announced its âreturn to Diamondâ with the Diamond DA20-C1 Eclipse for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This marks the company's first foray into the new simulator and represents a significant milestone in its efforts to provide users with the most accurate and detailed aircraft models possible. According to the developer, the decision to create the DA20-C1 for MSFS was inspired by a personal passion for flying the aircraft. "Being the aircraft that I currently fly, I thought it was only fitting to remodel it with as much detail as I can to give an accurate model and operation of the DA20-C1â. "I am thrilled to have made the decision to create this aircraft for MSFS, but it will take some time." While the development of the DA20-C1 for Microsoft Flight Simulator is currently the group's top priority, it has not ruled out the possibility of releasing a version for X-Plane in the future. "An X-Plane version will likely come later," the development team said. SimSolutions expressed its gratitude to its supporters and wished them a Happy New Year. "We thank you so much for the support this year and are wishing you a very Happy New Year," To find out more, visit their Discord </summary>
