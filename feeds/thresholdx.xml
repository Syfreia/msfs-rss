    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. SXAD has recently released their rendition of San Antonio International Airport (KSAT) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving Greater San Antonio with a yearly average of 9.4 million passengers, placing it among the busiest airports in Texas.  The airport was inaugurated in 1941, built on 490 ha of undeveloped land that was quickly taken by the US Army for training during WW2, then named Alamo Field. It hosted the 77th Reconnaissance Group, training personnel for overseas operations.  The end of the war saw its return to the city of San Antonio, followed by the construction of a second terminal in the early 1950s, along with a control tower and a baggage claim area. Then, in the late 60s, a new concourse was built with eight jet bridge gates.  In the mid 70s, a master plan was put into action to further develop the airport, with a new 33,000 square meters terminal and a larger parking garage, bringing the airport from eight to twenty seven gates.  Twenty years later, it was once again upgraded with a new parking garage that only reached completion in 2007.  In 2010, the old second terminal was closed, replaced by a brand new terminal with eight gates, designed by Corgan Associates, Inc. and 3D/International.Â   AeromÃ©xico Connect, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, United Express, VivaAerobus, and Volaris currently serve the airport.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom seasonal orthoimagery, custom PBR ground textures, baked night lighting and ambient occlusion, custom airport surroundings, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $19.99, requiring at least 1.2 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published another development update concerning the progress on the UFT, pending 737 marketplace updates, and their upcoming 777 for Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Randazzo begins with a note on how their Universal Flight Tablet is progressing, claiming âthings are getting exciting,â with weekly updates being pushed to the beta team to ensure itâs appropriately polished. While they do not have a release date yet, itâs said to be getting closer. Their testers are currently testing the performance calculators while PMDG refines the EFBâs functionality based on their feedback.  The tablet has also been fitted into the 777, and the testing of that plane will be simultaneous with its normal beta testing, meaning it will be there from day one. The airplane, on the other hand, is still under development, and they claim itâs bringing a tremendous improvement in performance, resource utilization, and visual quality and is fairly more integrated with the simulator.  The marketplace updates are running six weeks behind because Microsoft has made some changes to their intake and approval process, dragging on for a little longer than it used to, to no fault of their own (according to their claims).  Their 737 Lineup is available on theirÂ websiteÂ and the MSFS Marketplace, ranging from $34.99 to $69.99 depending on variant.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has released an update adding three brand new features to their popular Charts software. â The main feature within this update is the addition of digital ATIS. Users can now go to the âWeatherâ section within any airport on the map view, and view that airportâs current ATIS, along with live METAR and TAF information. The data for the ATIS can come from multiple different sources, including VATSIM, IVAO, and PilotEdge. At many larger airports within the United States, the ability to pull real-world digital ATIS information is also possible.  Navigraph has also added Flight Telemetry monitoring. This feature allows users to pull current aircraft information from the simulator, such as airspeed, altitude, ground speed, estimated time to destination, and much more. This feature can be personalized within the app, with the ability to pick and choose what information is displayed, or it can be completely turned off if desired. Finally, the team has added the ability to display Operational Flight Plans from SimBrief. This feature allows users to, according to Navigraph, make their flight planning process smoother and more efficient. This feature even more closely integrates Navigraphâs Charts product with the very popular SimBrief, after being acquired by Navigraph in 2021. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has published a teaser thread on their forums showcasing Matteo Venezianiâs work on their upcoming rendition of Gold Coast Airport (YBCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the seventh busiest airport in Australia. It was initially built as an airstrip (Coolangatta Airstrip) in the 1930s, being heavily used by the Australian Royal Air Force during World War 2. Post-war saw its return to civilian use, progressively expanding to meet the ever-growing demands for passenger traffic in the region, especially in the 50s and 60s. International status was granted in the 1980s after they had built its current terminal (Eric Robinson Building), inaugurated by acting Prime Minister Douglas Anthony. The airport was serving up to 650,000 passengers yearly at that point. The main terminal was expanded to 27,000 square meters in 2010, doubling its size, adding 40 check-in desks, and incorporating domestic and international operations. It houses Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin Australia, Rex, Air New Zealand, and Scoot. Thereâs no information about the pricing or a potential release date, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently released their rendition of Tenerife North-Ciudad de La Laguna Airport (GCXO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in Tenerife - the largest and most populous island in the canaries = with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  After five years of fund gathering, the airport was built in the late 30s to improve a spot where flights were already happening regularly ten years prior with C.L.A.S.S.A. â Commercial operations on the newly built airport started in 1941 with Iberiaâs fleet of DH89Aâs. Five years after its first proper commercial flight, the airport already had a couple of hangars, a passenger terminal, and a paved runway while also opening for domestic and international trafficâmultiple runway expansions followed during the subsequent decades. â The most significant runway expansion happened in 1964, when the runway was stretched to 3000 m to accommodate the DC-8, along with new navigation aids and an apron expansion. An ILS system was installed seven years later, in 1971.Â  â That decade marked the inauguration of Tenerife South, which only came to be because Tenerife North often suffered with thick fog, the main contributor to the Tenerife tragedy of 1977 involving two Boeing 747s, still the deadliest accident in aviation history. â A new terminal was inaugurated in 2002 with a four-story terminal building, 12 gates, and its international reopening after 24 years of domestic-only operations.Â  â Air Europa, Binter Canarias, CanaryFly, Iberia, IberiaExpress, Plus Ultra LÃ­neas AÃ©reas, Ryanair, and Vueling currently serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures and objects, animated jetways, animated custom vehicles, a modeled interior, realistic ground textures, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.38, requiring at least 1.99 GB of free hard disk space to install.

MFSG has recently released their rendition of Asahikawa Airport (RJEC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Asahikawa in Hokkaido, with a yearly average of 1 million passengers.  â After half a decade of planning, the airport was inaugurated in 1966, with scheduled service beginning that same year with Japan Domestic Airlines, flying a NAMC YS-11 to Tokyo Haneda via Okadama. It was primarily seasonal until 1970 when there was finally a year-round flight to Tokyo.  Nearly twenty years later, the airport was briefly closed for expansion work, with its sole runway being extended from 1,200 meters to 1,640 in February 1982 and then to 2,000 meters in November 1982, allowing the operation of larger jet aircraft like the DC-9, the MD-80, and the Airbus A300. â In 2016, the administration made plans to build a new international terminal to the south of the old one, with 5,700 square meters of constructed area, targeting 500,000 international passengers yearly by 2030. It opened in November 2018. â The airport is served by Air Do, All Nippon Airways (seasonally), Asiana Airlines, Japan Airlines, Tigerair Taiwan, and Tâway Air. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, custom ground textures, AI traffic compatibility, and more. â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.38, requiring at least 31.97 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RFscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Verona Villafranca Airport (LIPX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Italian city of Verona with a yearly average of 3.5 million passengers. â Built as an air base in the early 1900s and heavily used during World War I, it opened to civil air traffic not long after the conflict with daily connections to Rome and multiple charter flight destinations in northern Europe. â A passenger terminal was built in the late 1970s by the Province of Verona, the Commune of Verona, and the Local Chamber of Commerce. A managing society was formed shortly after, sharing the ownership between provincial governments from Veneto, Lombardy, Trentino, and Alto Adige. â With healthy growth figures in the late 90s and early 2000s, the administration decided to expand the airport by constructing a new arrivals terminal, inaugurated in 2006. â Aer Lingus, Air Albania, AirBaltic (seasonally), Air Dolomiti, Albawings, British Airways, easyJet, Eurowings (seasonally), Finnair (seasonally), FlyOne, Jet2 (seasonally), Neos, Norwegian Air Shuttle (seasonally), Play (seasonally), Ryanair, Transavia (seasonally), TUI Airways, Volotea, and WizzAir serve the airport. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom airport buildings, custom ground vehicles, custom ground textures, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.06, requiring at least 374.60 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  Low-End Pc Studios has recently released their rendition of Coronel FAP Francisco Secada Vignetta International Airport (SPQT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Peruvian city of Iquitos with a yearly average of 1 million passengers. â It was built in the late 1920s as a gravel airstrip for military purposes, eventually evolving into a commercial airport over the following decades, along with several infrastructural upgrades and expansions.Â  â Its current name was adopted in 1973 after a local Peruvian Air Force pilot who had fought in the war with Colombia between 1932 and 1933. â The airport is of great importance to the cityâs economy because itâs only accessible by air or river, meaning every urgent logistical operation has to go through the airport, which also justifies the relatively high passenger figures in comparison with the cityâs population (1 million passengers yearly, and the city has less than half a million inhabitants). Said figures make it the fourth busiest airport in Peru. â LATAM Peru, SAETA Peru, Sky Airline Peru, and Star Peru serve the airport year-round.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a custom ground mesh, PBR textures, terminal interior modeling, custom runway elevation profile, animated objects, and a performance-friendly optimization. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.16, requiring at least 150.09 MB of free hard disk space to install.
