    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Secret Studio has recently released their rendition of Bintulu Airport (WBGB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Bintulu Division in Sarawak, Malaysia, with a yearly average of 1 million passengers.  The old airport was built in 1937 by the British as an airfield, only becoming an actual airport in 1955, when it had a single grass runway and was served by de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Riptides and Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneers operated by Borneo Airways.  In the 60s, with the advent of bigger - and heavier - airliners, the runway was resurfaced with Bitumen and the terminal building was expanded to comport more passengers.  The new Bintulu was built in the early 2000s, replacing the old airport with better infrastructure, a longer runway, and a bigger terminal, comporting up to one million passengers.  Itâs served by AirAsia (Kota Kinabalu, Kuala LumpurâInternational, Kuching), Malaysia Airlines (Kuala LumpurâInternational), and MASWings (Miri, Mukah, Sibu).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR texturing, an in-house VDGS system, custom animated jetways, custom ground textures, a true-to-life passenger terminal, custom terraforming, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $8.16, requiring at least 262.17 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Microsoftâs presentation on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 was the most well-attended announcement at Flight Sim Expo 2023. It has been almost three years since they released the platform, and everyone is excited about the upcoming MSFS 2024. I had the privilege to sit down with Jorg Neumann, head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, to talk about the recently announced simulator. â Threshold: This is your first time at the Flight Sim Expo. How are you liking it so far? â Neumann: Itâs wonderful. We often go to big games showsâlike back in the day E3 or Gamescomâwith like tens of thousands of people, but this is more focused. Itâs a single group of people who share a hobby and you can feel that they love it. Everyone is incredibly friendly and encouraging, and it feels like a community thatâs very healthy. Weâre very happy to finally be here for the first time. â Threshold: When you envisioned Flight Sim 2024, what was the overall goal that you wanted to achieve? â Neumann: Flight Sim is a platform, right, and we want to empower people. Thatâs actually the number one thing we try to do. Because the creator community that has formed is critical. Itâs absolutely critical to the success of this field.Â  â Threshold: What in particular do you want Flight Sim 2024 to address? â Neumann: The sheer amount and size of addons. It was probably unexpected how much has been created already. We are now counting over 3,000 addons, with about 100 a week. We know that we need to enable that for the long haul. â Threshold: What is the main challenge? â Neumann: Flight Sim 2020 was just never conceived for the amount of data thatâs coming in. And then on top of that, I promised that we would do monthly updates, and Iâm totally determined to keep doing that. I should have just looked at the tally of gigabytes going up month over month over month. Weâre now at 300-something gigabytes. We just plotted this out and said: âHoly moly, weâre going to be at 1 terabyte soon, and then weâre going to be at 2 terabytes, and nobody can download this stuff anymore.â It's crazy! â Threshold: How are you addressing that? â Neumann: We knew we needed to make an architectural change that basically offloads more to the cloud, because you can stream infinitely, the ecosystem is no longer limited. Right now we are running out of memory sometimes. When a highly complex plane comes in, like a PMDG plane, itâs so detailed. We run into limitations, and I donât want those limitations to keep the sim from being the best it can be. So weâve changed the architecture fundamentally to go to a thin client. That enables groups like PMDG to make infinitely detailed planes. It sets us up for the long term. â Threshold: There have been questions about access for addon developers, for access to different APIs. As an example, with MSFS 2024, would weather radar APIs be available for developers? â Neumann: The weather radar is technically a little bit outside what I know specifics on, but as far as I understand what theyâre asking for, we donât have it. Itâs not like we are the jerks who donât want to give access to something, we just donât have the memory. I believe itâs because, like I just said, weâre running out of resources. To have the weather for the entire platform, thereâs nothing to be shared at this moment. I have to defer to some of the experts on the team to talk about this more, but the intent is always to empower people to do their best work. So every time you see us as not doing something, thereâs a technical reason for it, not a political one. â Threshold: Thank you, and I know weâre all looking forward to getting a chance to fly MSFS 2024. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is shaping up to be a promising new simulator that will undoubtedly change the world of flight simulation!  â Threshold will keep you updated with all things MSFS 2024, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of London Stansted Airport (EGSS) scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in the UK after Heathrow, Gatwick, and Manchester, with a yearly average of 23 million passengers.  Stansted was originally a bomber airfield and maintenance depot for WW2, inaugurated in 1943 by the Royal Air Force and shared between them and the USAF.  Twenty years after the war, Stansted was embraced by holiday charter operators looking for a cheaper alternative to Gatwick and Heathrow. It resulted in fast growth, leading to a new development plan in the mid-80s to expand the airportâs capacity to 15 million passengers a year.  Construction work started in the late 80s at the cost of roughly 100 million pounds, adding a railway branch to the airport. It won the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 1990.  A new expansion program followed between 2007 and 2009, adding 5,900 square meters of terminal area. A few years later, in 2013, the terminal underwent a redevelopment plan to modernize the airport further.  The airport is a Ryanair, Jet2.com, and TUI hub, flying people across Europe and North Africa. Itâs mostly a low-cost carrier airport, with the eventual seasonal presence of British Airways and Lufthansa.  Stansted is also widely used for cargo, visited by Asiana Cargo, Cargolux, China Cargo Airlines, China Southern Cargo, FedEx Express, Qatar Airways Cargo, Turkish Cargo, UPS Airlines, and Turkmenistan Airlines.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, high-detail terminal buildings, and their respective interiors, a custom GSX profile, custom jetways, LOD optimization on every model, custom static aircraft, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $17.57, requiring at least 5.86 GB of free hard disk to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Microsoft and Aeroplane Heaven Release Boeing 307 Stratoliner for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Microsoft Flight Simulator team partnered with Aeroplane Heaven to develop the 10th airplane of their âLocal Legendâ series: the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, the first airliner in revenue service with a pressurized cabin. Its roots date back to 1935, when five of the biggest North American carriers had signed a contract with Douglas to fund the development of the DC-4, with a contribution of $100,000 each and an agreement not to fly other aircraft that were within its expected weight figures. The project was a disaster, leading to the airlines canceling their orders, yet still wishing to buy a large four-engine airplane at one point. Later that same year, Boeing designed a four-engine aircraft based on the B-17, with a larger pressurized part of the fuselage and the same wings, tail, rudder, undercarriage, and engines. Over the following months, the engineers extensively tested the pressurization by coating the fuselage with soapy water and then watching for bubbles indicating an air leak.  Three years later, the prototype was ready to roll, flying for the first time in late 1938 and eventually crashing in early 1939 after a nearly irrecoverable stall that tore off the left outer wing with the engine still attached. The ten occupants were killed that day. After figuring out what caused the accident and coming up with a solution, the program was finally back on track, with the approval to operate commercially in March 1940 and Pan Am being the first customer.  The Stratoliner could cruise at speeds of 350 km/h at 20,000ft, with a crew of six and either 33, 38, or 60 passengers, with a range of 3,846 km. Itâs available on the MSFS Marketplace for $14.99. â</summary>

    <title>Simworks Studios Announces TBM series and Kodiak 900 for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimWorks Studios took to their Discord server to unveil the first renditions of their Kodiak 900 and to announce the TBM series for Microsoft Flight Simulator ! â The exterior model for the Kodiak 900 is fully completed and ready to get in the simulator for testing. The 900 model, sharing a lot of features with the previously released 100 model, allows for a swift and efficient setup and testing process, thanks to its practically identical foundation regarding their codebase. This compatibility drastically reduces the initial work needed to get an aircraft up to scratch, leaving more room for refinement and enhancements for their newest addition.Â  The strength of the Kodiak 100âs codebase spares developers from the need to start from scratch, thus significantly streamlining the development process for the Kodiak 900. The Kodiak 900 will have an improved 3D model, not only in visual appearance but also in terms of performance. â And the exciting news doesnât stop there ! SimWorks Studios is thrilled to announce the TBM series for MSFS. Following a licensing agreement with Daher back in January, they had gained the rights to recreate the TBM 850, 910 and 960 models. Although the launch is quite a distance away, work on these aircraft will commence in August.Â  â The upside of this is that the majority of the required avionics will be mostly ready by then. The TBM850âs EFIS40 is notably akin to the PC-12âs, significantly simplifying its integration. Plus the maturity of the G1000 and G3000, along with their new plugin system support, will facilitate the creation of an authentic avionics package. â Importantly, the forthcoming TBMâs will inherit the code base of the preceding Kodiaks and their PC-12. This means a significant portion of the ground work will be completed in advance which will ultimately allow them to focus on other areas. â This is all exciting news and although no price or release date has been announced, Threshold will keep you informed with all this once it becomes available. â</summary>
