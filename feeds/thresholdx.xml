    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Barelli MSFS Addon has recently released their rendition of Bucharest Henri CoandÄ International Airport (LROP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Bucharestâs metropolitan area with a yearly average of 12 million passengers.  It was used as an airbase by the Germans during World War 2 and then taken over by the Romanian Air Force afterward until its conversion into a commercial airport in 1965, followed by heavy modernization and expansion (the new runway was one of the longest in Europe at the time).  A VIP lounge was inaugurated in 1969 for Richard Nixonâs visit (American president), and a new passenger terminal was inaugurated in the following year, with a total capacity of 1,200,000 passengers per year for domestic and international flights.  It underwent a three-phase expansion program in the 90s, starting with constructing a new departure terminal and airside concourse. The second phase led to the construction of a domestic terminal, a control tower overhaul, and the transformation of the old terminal building into a dedicated arrivals hall. The third and final phase involved the extension of the airside concourse with fifteen new gates and a departure hall expansion. Both expansions added 55,600 square meters to the terminalâs total area.  Itâs a hub for Animawings, HiSky, Ryanair, TAROM, and WizzAir. The visitorsâ list includes Aegean Airlines, Air France, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Eurowings, KLM, LOT, Lufthansa, Qatar, Swiss, and Turkish Airlines.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $18.37, requiring at least 166.49 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. A new F-104 Star Fighter is coming to X-Plane 12 Brought to you by Colimata! The Starfighter, developed by Lockheed, is a supersonic air superiority fighter designed to quickly claim control of enemy airspace. This required it to be super maneuverable and fast. The unique characteristics of its stubby wings, T-tail empennage, and dartish shape make it unmistakable from anything else. Later, it was developed into an all-role, multi-weather aircraft during the 60s, giving it more versatility. Over two thousand airframe variants were built, with the final retirement by the Italian Air Force in 2004, after serving for over fifteen air forces. The Starfighter was fast, designed with the GE J79 turbojet giving performance up to Mach 1.7, even increasing to Mach 2 for later variants. Max thrust produced 15,880 pounds in full burner and 10,000 at military power. The fuel system is supported by tip tanks, internal tanks, and pylons, totaling up to 12,260 lbs. Colimata shared previews of the upcoming aircraft via screenshots in this forum post. These images show off the loadmaster configuration interface, allowing you to load weapons from rockets to missiles and drop tanks to various hard points on the 104's airframe. The Star Fighter will have a custom radar supporting air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. These modes offer multiple levels of complexity based on the user's skill and avionics knowledge. C functions aid with targeting hostile aircraft and armaments. Citing Colimatas post, The package will include three variants, with each unique cockpits. These models range from the G variant, S, and the 21c with the most modern cockpit. Colimanta states that all variants will come with a "versatile" nav system that will work with X-Plane flight plans. Quoting Colimatas targeting system statement. â Further posts covered updates of external modeling. Colimata emphasizes details of the 3d model, such as animated systems and livery textures amounting to 4k high-resolution textures. Minor important details like the thousands of rivets, panel details, and decals across the airframe are accurately reproduced based on the real-world counterpart.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has just launched the sixth edition of their FlightSim Community Survey, asking the community to answer questions ranging from their preferred flight simulation platform and add-ons to the hardware they use and why they simulate, providing a complete understanding of the modern flight sim demographic.Â   Averaging more than 20,000 respondents since the 2020 edition, the Survey has become the go-to reference for hardware metrics, given it differs massively compared to mainstream reference data such as the Steam Hardware Survey, which takes their entire user base into account. Focusing exclusively on flight simmers, it provides a more accurate image of the most popular hardware among virtual pilots.Â   It also sheds light on the most popular flight sim platform, intent (whether simulating just for fun or training for a pilotâs license), simulation proficiency, and how many of us are real-life pilots.Â   The Survey will run for ten days from today (November 17), and the results will be published on their website in December 2023. It is entirely GDPR compliant and fully anonymous, with no personally identifiable data being collected and no redirects.Â   ClickÂ hereÂ to participate in the worldâs most comprehensive flight simulation survey!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published a new development update with information on the next 737 Lineup update, marketplace intake, and the upcoming 777 for Microsoft Flight Simulator.  The next update for the 737 lineup is already with their testing team for validation, including new features developed in the background and now ready, along with structural changes that aim to improve the tablet's stability within the MSFS environment.Â   PMDG has added data interoperability between the airplane and tablet, allowing users to see route changes reflected in the tablet's live map and providing increased situational awareness.  As it has been the norm since build 3.00.0080, the upcoming update will focus on the Universal Flight Tablet alone. The complete changelog follows below: 0012722: [EFB - General] Metars stop functioning between 0000z and 0100z (rmurdoch) 0012788: [EFB - General] PMDG map tiles names are fuzzy (rmurdoch) 0012777: [EFB - General] Fully convert to JSON for tablet-plane comms (rmurdoch) 0012782: [EFB - General] UFT 1.2 "New route loaded" message appears too often (rmurdoch) 0012475: [EFB - Simbrief] CO RTE field not showing CO RTE name (cbpowell) 0012783: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Arrival Airport Calls for Runway, not ICAO code. (cbpowell) 0012792: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Imported Flight plan times do not match Simbrief (cbpowell) 0012645: [EFB - General] Tablet map should pick up changes made on the FMS (rmurdoch) 0012692: [EFB - Performance and Computational] Landing Dispatch Data should be imported into Landing Enroute fields (cbpowell) 0012775: [EFB - General] Tablet namespace differentiation still not working correctly (rmurdoch) â They plan to release the update for PMDG.com customers around the final week of November.Â   Build 3.00.0082 has been submitted to Microsoft for the intake process, and PMDG believes it should become available sometime next week (Microsoft's intake process is not an exact science).  The Xbox version of the aforementioned build will take longer, as PMDG found issues with some key functions and is working with Microsoft and Asobo to find a solution.  The upcoming 777 is still being worked on, with PMDG's focus on handling characteristics and system validation. They claim it hasn't been previewed yet because they have been packing details and features into the new product that will demand time to get to where they want and that the previewing process will begin once it's nearing entering testing. PMDG believes this extra attention to development will yield a shorter testing cycle.  The current PMDG lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator is available on theirÂ website, ranging from $34.99 to $69.99.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. VSKYLABS announced the development of the HC-02 in early March of this year. The early access phase for the model has recently been completed. The HC-02 model was built using an actual HC-02 as a reference, with the team working steadily on the project. Real-world feedback was obtained from HC-02 pilots to create the most realistic flight model possible for the aircraft. The Hungarocopter, designed in Hungary, is an ultralight helicopter that uses the latest design technologies and construction methods. The HC-02 is powered by a Rotax 915, which can produce up to 141 Hp, allowing it to reach cruise speeds of 87 knots. With room for two people, the helicopter has a maximum range of 400km and an endurance of 2.5 hours. VSKYLABS has spent extensive time modeling the cockpit with detail and accuracy to give VR headset users a feeling of being inside the cockpit. VSKYLABS also brought all new first simulated systems to X-Plane, such as the Electric Rescue System. According to VSKYLABS, the ERS is a  The HC-02 offers several features, including Avitab compatibility and a custom FMOD sound pack. The V1.1 update improves flight dynamics, displays, interaction, and visual model. The FMOD sound pack is now updated with additional sounds as well. The Hungarocopter is compatible with X-Plane 11/12 and is available at X-Plane.org store for $19.47 and VSKYLABS.com for $18.85. These prices are still valid as of November 18th, 2023.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Miltech Simulations has provided a development update for their Boeing CH-47D Chinook. The update, which was posted to their Facebook page, highlights their recent focus on finishing the 3D model and texturing and also includes some new screenshots of the interior texturing.Â  The CH-47D Chinook is a tandem-rotor transport helicopter first developed by Vertol in 1957 and later manufactured by Boeing. The CH-47D has a maximum take-off weight of 50,000 lbs and a range of 400 nautical miles. Production started on the CH-47 in 1962 and continues to this day.Â  â Miltech also noted some features to be expected upon release of the CH-47 including a fully modeled interior and exterior, multiple cargo types from Humvees to fully animated paratroopers, and a âcomprehensive yet practical renditionâ of the Chinookâs systems. Miltech has been very upfront about some systems being âfor display onlyâ due to Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs limitations. Miltech also promises that an EFB will be included at launch. Another feature that was noted in the update is the inclusion of a soundtrack that is based on recordings from a Chinook. The update included a look at possibilities post-release including an expansion pack that would add other variants of the Chinook including the more modern âFâ variant. Currently, there is no release date set however Miltech states that PC users will see the release first with Xbox following shortly after. The stated reason for the planned delay is due to Microsoft's marketplace verification. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim updates! â</summary>
