    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published a new development update in their forum featuring work-in-progress flight deck previews of their upcoming Boeing 777 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Randazzo begins with a promise: they will try to be more transparent with their development process, showing stuff behind the scenes, like their recent trip to compare their 777 with the real 777. He emphasizes they have never done it before but have been considering it since Mathijs Kok joined the team and advocated for more sharing.  The beta process is ongoing, and they have been focusing on killing conflicts between their C++ code and Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs Clang compiler, aiming for high stability. With the release window potentially getting closer, they have been working on preview images and video, which will roll out gradually. PMDG is feeling very good about the project and is looking for a suitable release timeline, which will be communicated beforehand.  â Their new preview showcases parts of the cockpit that make their 3D modeler happy, details that were impossible with the previous platforms. They think itâs the finest 777 simulation yet created outside and even inside the enterprise environment, with more to come on that later. â âWe are absolutely certain she will meet even the highest expectations for 777 lovers and 777 interested simmers alikeâ, concludes Randazzo.  â Thereâs no release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Gold Coast Airport (YBCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Gold Coast and Tweed Heads, Australia, with a yearly average of 6.4 million passengers, making it the 7th busiest airport in the country. â  It was built in 1936, consisting of three grass strips whose sole intent was to provide an emergency landing spot for aircraft flying between Brisbane and Sydney, with passenger service only beginning three years later. Regular service was only to begin after WW2, with Queensland Airlines and Butler Air Transport, followed by Ansett in 1950 and Trans Australia Airlines in 1954. â  Taxiways and runways were fully paved by 1958, allowing for the operation of larger, heavier aircraft such as the DC-9 and L-188 Electra. â  The current passenger terminal was opened in 1981 by Acting Prime Minister Douglas Anthony. The following year saw the main runway extended to 2,042 meters, allowing for the operation of wide-body jet aircraft. It was later extended to 2,500 meters sometime in 2007. â The passenger terminal was upgraded in 2010, with an expansion that doubled its total size, accommodating a decade's worth of growth in passenger volume. It was then expanded again in 2016, 2019, and 2022, with a 30,000-square-meter expansion and overall infrastructure modernization.  â It's a hub for Bonza. AirAsia X, Air New Zealand, Eastern Air Services, Jetstar, Qantas, QantasLink, Rex Airlines, Seair Pacific, and Virgin Australia serve it regularly. â  Developed by Matteo Veneziani, the scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, 4K textures, an interior on the main terminal, unique GSE vehicles, dynamic airport lighting, custom ground textures, custom animated jetways, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â  It's available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.20, requiring at least 4.70 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Ontario International Airport (KONT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of San Bernardino, Riverside, and Greater Los Angeles with a yearly average of 5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1941 as an Army Air Corps aircraft training and operation base. After the war, it became a large storage, sale, and scrapping center for Army Air Forces aircraft.Â  â Shortly after, in 1946, the airport was renamed from âOntario Municipal Airportâ to âOntario International Airportâ because of outgoing trans-Pacific cargo flights. The first international passenger flight happened that same year, a Pacific Overseas Airlines flight from Shanghai to Ontario, inaugurating round-trip air passenger service between the United States and the Orient. Western Airlines began operating at the airport three years later, followed by Bonanza Air Lines in 1955. â A new terminal was opened in 1998, discontinuing the old terminals, which now function as the administration and the USO. There are 26 gates total, with 12 on T2 and 14 on T4. Terminal 2 hosts Alaska Airlines, Avianca El Salvador, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines, and Volaris. Terminal 4 hosts American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest. â Itâs a FedEx and UPS Airlines cargo hub, transporting cargo all over North America and Asia (UPS). Amazon Air, Ameriflight, Amerijet International, Asia Pacific Airlines, and Kalitta Air also serve it. Ontario International is the ninth-largest cargo airport in the United States. â â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with over 60 highly detailed building models with PBR texturing, custom ground poly, custom animated jetways with gate numbering, improved taxiway and runway lighting, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.26, requiring at least 714.80 MB of free hard disk space to install.

In a lengthy announcement in their Discord and on the iniBuilds forum, Synaptic Simulations has announced that they will be moving away from having their rendition of the Airbus A220 for free, to a payware model, with support from iniBuilds, and they will be adding Xbox support as well. â In their post, they elaborate on some of the reasons why they moved away from a freeware to a payware product: âThis decision comes out of a realization of the project's potential as well as the ever-growing development demands during often busy and stressful times for our team.â Also in the announcement were more details concerning what will come with the Synaptic A220 on release, which will feature both the -300 and -100 variants, as well as an ACJ220 variant coming in âlater as a free upgrade to customers of the base package.â  Synaptic also addresses concerns about this change, saying âWe understand any unfavorable feelings you may have toward this decision, as it was a tough one for us to make knowing the support you have all given us with the promise of a free and open-source add-on. We hope that you will remain committed to this project, as our commitment to deliver the best A220 experience remains steady.â The Synaptic team say that they will publish an FAQ in the âvery near future,â and that they encourage the community to ask questions in the meantime. â Although nothing about a release window or pricing has been announced yet, Threshold will keep you informed once we know, so stay tuned for that, and for more high quality flight simulation news, reviews, and more!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flight Simulation Design Group has just released their newest foray into the flight simulation scenery space, recreating the island and airport of Kefalonia, Greece, in Microsoft Flight Simulator. Kefalonia is the first in a series of products that FSDG is calling the âScenic Routes Edition.â Kefalonia, or Cephalonia, is the largest of the Ionian islands in the Adriatic Sea off of the west coast of Greece. It is a popular destination for many European tourists during the summer for its fair weather. Kefaloniaâs Airport is served by many low-cost carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair, and TUI, but almost all of its air traffic is seasonal, with only one route to Athens served by Aegean Airways being operated year-round.  FSDGâs rendition of Kefalonia features not only the airport but many landmarks around the island and buildings such as hotels. The airport itself features high-quality texturing and modeling, as well as 3D interiors, and custom night lighting. You can get Kefalonia for â¬15.69 on SimMarket, and it will take up approximately 3.98GB of disk space.</summary>

    <title>Microsoft Dev Stream Recap: SU15, G3X Touch, and More</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. In their most recent developer livestream hosted on Wednesday, Microsoft and Asobo showed off more features for the upcoming Sim Update 15, an overhaul to the default G3X by Working Title, a few more bits on the highly anticipated MSFS 2024, and much more! â Starting off with Sim Update 15, the newest update to the simulator is slated to land on March 12th, with a public beta starting soon. The main focus for this update is improving performance, and especially with memory usage improvements. Working with Working Title Simulations, Microsoft and Asobo have been able to squeeze more performance out of the glass cockpits by reworking the CoherentGT thread, which is the process that renders glass cockpits, and is a common pitfall when it comes to performance with complex glass cockpit aircraft.  As for memory allocation, the Asobo team was able to backport the technology from the upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the most benefit will come to those low in RAM, or have a stutter-filled experience. A new system for handling AI and ATC interaction with airports will also be coming in the update as well, and fixes to the many bugs and quirks that the system has gotten a reputation for. In addition, many highly requested fixes that concern snow coverage, with the sim incorrectly freezing over lakes being one of the many fixes.  Also, Jorg Neumann, Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator has confirmed that Microsoft Flight Simulator will be expanding support for Xbox Cloud Gaming in SU15, adding support for mobile devices and touchscreens. Finally, dual-rotor support has been added, allowing developers to finally be able to correct popular helicopters such as the Chinook, and the V22 Osprey. Another thing revealed during this monthâs dev livestream was the reworked Garmin G3X Touch built by Working Title Simulations. It will feature all the goodies we can expect from a Working Title rework, including a faithful recreation of the styling, layout, and symbology of the real G3X unit, as well as having a functioning EIS page, and specific configurations for different aircraft types. When it releases, the new G3X Touch will come installed in the default XCub, NXCub, and VL-3.  Moving on to the iniBuilds A320neo, which is currently still in the development phase, after coming under stability issues during the Sim Update 14 Beta, as well as speculation that it violated the GPL. Jorg Neumann addressed the question of the release date saying, âIâm not 100% sure itâs going to make SU15â¦itâs tightâ¦[it] wonât be in the first beta for sure.â There was a lot in this monthâs dev stream, so here are some of the other points that didnât make it into the larger categories: â You can watch the whole one and a half hour stream on their Twitch channel. â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more high-quality flight simulation news and reviews!</summary>
