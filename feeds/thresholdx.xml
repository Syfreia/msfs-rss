    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Simbrief is the most popular and widely used flight sim dispatch system which is offered for free by parent company Navigraph. Itâs been a considerable amount of time since anything major has changed with SimBrief after the acquisition by Navigraphâ¦ Until now that is! Simbrief has received a complete re-design and new look which streamlines the entire service and gives it a fresh, new, easy-to-use look.Â  The new SimBrief look has certainly gone down well with the flight sim community so far since its release a short time ago, many think it is a fantastic new design which not only makes it easier to use but adds more neat features such as personal flying statistics.Â  â Other new features in this update include:Â  You can check this latest version of simbrief out for yourself over at www.simbrief.com â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Rfscenerybuilding has recently released their rendition of Brussels South Charleroi Airport (EBCI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, also referred to as Brussels-Charleroi Airport. It is the second busiest airport in Belgium, with a yearly average of 8 million passengers (pre-pandemic).  Charleroi is a popular low-cost alternative to Brussels Airport (EBBR), being an important hub for Ryanair, WizzAir, and TUI fly Belgium, both offering an extensive intra-European network. Itâs also home to Air Belgium, a scheduled and charter airline founded six years ago offering many holiday destinations, including Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mauritius, and South Africa. The history of Brussels-Charleroi dates back to 1919 when it used to be a flying school, with maintenance activities to start a year later. To this day, itâs still a busy general aviation airfield with three flying schools.  The airportâs traffic grew in the late 1990s when Ryanair embraced Charleroi for the first time (it went on to become one of their continental bases). Other low-cost carriers like WizzAir soon joined the trend, increasing the traffic figures and justifying the construction of a new terminal, which opened in early 2008 with a capacity for up to 5 million passengers a year. It wasnât long until it reached that limit, which led to the creation of a second terminal in 2017, accommodating up to 10 million passengers a year.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it stands, with custom buildings around the area, custom vehicles, custom objects and clutter, navigation infrastructure, and custom lighting. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $19.26, requiring at least 680 MB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Oslo Gardermoen Airport (ENGM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in Norway with 30 million passengers per year. Opened 25 years ago, Gardermoen replaces the outdated Fornebu Airport, which used to be the main airport in Oslo from its inception in 1939 to 1998. Bigger, substantially more modern, and with better accessibility, the new airport went on to become the busiest airport in Scandinavia.  Sporting over 200 destinations (domestic and international), OSL is a hub for Norse Atlantic Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, and Wideroe. The visitors' list includes most major european airlines, such as Air France, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia, KLM, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Swiss, TAP Air Portugal, Turkish, and WizzAir. Trondheim (2,092,000), Bergen (1,987,000), and Stavanger (1,603,000) are among the top three busiest destinations from Gardermoen, further reinforcing the strength of domestic operations in the airport.  The scenery features detailed modeling and texturing of the terminal and surrounding buildings and hangars, with PBR texturing in 4K, interior modeling, three different types of animated jetways to match the real world, fully functioning VDGS for all appropriate gates, animated traffic, custom ground service equipment, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $20.62, requiring at least 6.34 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Lognes-Ãmerainville aerodrome (LFPL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the community of Lognes in the suburbs of Paris (roughly 28 km east of it).  Opened to public air traffic in 1947, itâs the biggest private light aircraft aerodrome in the country, with the unusuality of being open to international traffic, unlike many other french airfields. The fact it sits close to five other aerodromes makes it extremely handy for flight schools, increasing its traffic figures. Lognes is open to light aviation under VFR, handling up to 80,568 aircraft movements back in 2014, ranking it within the top 10 in France (movement-wise).  With a 700-meter-long paved runway and a 1,100-meter-long grass runway, the airfield is ideal for small general aviation aircraft, especially trainers such as the 152, 172, etc. As a curiosity, Lognes hosts AGILE, an association created in 1983 whose focus is the management of the 25 to 30 aircraft that belong to the clubâs members.The scenery features an accurate rendition of the aerodrome, with PBR texturing based on on-site photography, detailed modeling including the tower interior, animated humans, and custom lighting.  Itâs available for free on SimMarket, requiring at least 275 MB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FeelThere Releases Nashville International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fthnas" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/63f006fabb25c11a994ce745_nash1.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="1222254"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Nashville International Airport (KBNA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Nashville Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 18 million passengers.  Opened in June 1937, passenger service started a month later with American Airlines and Eastern Air Lines. It originally featured three runways, a three-story passenger terminal, a control tower, two hangars, and a beacon. The yearly figures hit nearly 190,000 passengers.  It was used as the headquarters for the 4th Ferrying Command during World War 2, ferrying aircraft to Europe at the height of the war. The ferrying operations demanded a lot of space, which implied an expansion to 1,500 acres of total area.Â   Nearly a decade later, the City Aviation Department made plans to modernize and expand the airport, with a new terminal, runway expansion, and a new crosswind runway to come in 1961.  As a curiosity, Nashville Intl. was the first municipal airport in the United States with a public reading room.Â   It has seen a lot of expansion work over the following years, with its peak in the late 1980s, when American Airlines made a hub in Nashville and attracted many companies to the city, such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation. The hub eventually closed in 1995, when American couldnât afford to lose any more money (it wasnât profitable even during its heyday).Â   The airport has been recently modernized, with operations starting in 2006 and reaching its conclusion five years later, expanding the ticketing and check-in areas, renovating and constructing new bathrooms, and bringing the total size of the terminal to 1 million square feet. In 2021, the operator made a plan called âNew Horizonâ to further improve the airport, at the cost of 1.5 billion USD. Construction is set to begin in 2023 and reach completion in late 2028.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with over a hundred custom-modeled buildings, taxi bridges, custom night lighting, custom jetways, and custom ground polygon.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ and onÂ FeelThereâs ShopÂ for $21.39/$19.99 (respectively), requiring at least 609 MB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Realworldscenery has recently released their rendition of Fairbanks International Airport (PAFA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Fairbanks (Alaska), the smallest city in the country with regularly scheduled non-stop international flights.  The airportâs history dates back to 1951, when it replaced Ladd Army Airfield as the gateway to Fairbanks, serving as Alaska Airlinesâ main hub up until 1967 when they moved to Anchorage, yet keeping the Anchorage - Fairbanks service. It was also an important stopover for Braniff International, Pan American World Airways, American Airlines, and Western Airlines in the 60s and 70s. To conform with the current TSA standards, the original terminal (from 1948) was entirely demolished and replaced by a brand new one in late 2009, featuring better design and security, an extra jetway bridge (six instead of five), handling an average of 1 million passengers per year.  Itâs the hub for Everts Air, operating scheduled and charter airline cargo all across Alaska and Canada with a fleet of classic aircraft, including the C-46, the Douglas DC-6, and the Douglas MD-83. It also hosts Warbelowâs Air Ventures and Wright Air Service. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, custom-made buildings, performance-friendly optimization, and a realistic taxiway layout.  Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $18.58, requiring at least 1.3 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Salvuz has recently released their rendition of Bergen Airport (ENBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in Norway with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  Dating back to the early 1950s, Bergen Airport was partially funded by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana with 4 million Norwegian kroner, securing the construction of a terminal and a 1,460-meter-long runway. NATO funded an expansion in 1953, warranting a 2,440-meter-long runway instead. When the first flight landed at the airport in mid-1954, only 800 meters of it were complete. It was a chartered flight from Bergen to Oslo, transporting a local football team.  Itâs a hub for Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e, with an extensive domestic and intra-European network. According to 2014 data, Scandinavian Airlines had 46% of the market share for domestic flights, Norwegian had 38%, and WiderÃ¸e 15%. International-wise, Norwegian led the way with 36%, SAS had 23%, and KLM with 18% (with a single route to Amsterdam).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, sporting handcrafted buildings and facilities with detailed interiors, PBR texturing in 2K or 4K, two custom jetway models, precise terrain markings according to the latest charts, sloped runways with accurate altitude profiles, and parking stands as per latest AIP charts.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of the Bf108 Taifun for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a single-engine sport aircraft from the early 1930s.Â   Designed to compete in the 4th Challenge International de Tourisme in 1934, a major aviation event in pre-war Europe held in Warsaw, Poland, the Taifun was then just a prototype called M34, powered by a 247 horsepower Hirth HM 8U V8 engine, which didnât manage to win the event but impressed with a low fuel consumption rate, good handling and itâs superb take-off/landing characteristics.  The Bf108a, the first variant, took off for the first time in that same year, powered by three different engines (on different airframes): the original Hirth HM 8U, the Argus As 17B with 217 hp, and later units had a Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial, with 158hp. The Bf108b was a revision whose prototype rocked a Siemens-Halske Sh 14a radial, but the production units had either the Argus AS 10C (237hp) or the Argus AS 10E (266hp).  iniBuildsâ second classic aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator makes use of the latest CFD technology including the primary flight surfaces, control surfaces, and the propeller. It also simulates unique characteristics of the airplane such as the capability of landing as slow as 45 knots thanks to its advanced leading edge slats. Such slow speed allows it to operate on very short runways.  The engine is accurately reproduced with its correct performance and behavior, with a fully modeled and functional fuel system that makes use of the new fuel mechanics offered by the simulator.Â   A custom electronic flight bag allows for folding and unfolding the wings, opening storage compartments, choosing a custom rain cover, and changing the cockpit labels from German to English and from metric to imperial. It also features a moving map, weather information, a maintenance page, and other settings.  The aircraft is available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $18.01, requiring at least 2.66 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MM Simulations has recently released their rendition of Turku Airport (EFTU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Turku in Finland with a yearly average of 450,000 passengers, making it the fourth busiest airport in the country. Located in the airport district in the Maaria-Paatinen ward, which is the most sparsely populated district in Turku and includes half of the cityâs area, it was built in 1955 when it was still part of Rusko, becoming part of Turku three years later.  Turku Airport underwent a heavy renovation process in mid-2014 when Finavia spent over 14 million euros on improving Terminal One and the passenger apron. Terminal 2 was closed and demolished a year later after an oil leakage, concentrating the low-cost operations on the first floor of the main terminal. Itâs currently served by six different airlines: AirBaltic (Riga), Amapola Flyg (Mariehamn), Finnair (Helsinki), Scandinavian Airlines (Stockholm-Arlanda), Sunclass Airlines (seasonal legs to Gran Canaria and Tenerife South), and WizzAir (Gdansk and Rome Fiumicino). Gdansk is the busiest route as of 2019, with 117,261 passengers, followed by Helsinki and Stockholm, with 100,086 and 86,331, respectively. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with updated CGL data, real-world-based terraforming profile, PBR materials, ambient animated objects, custom interior modeling, and custom 3D people. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.86, requiring at least 2.44 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
