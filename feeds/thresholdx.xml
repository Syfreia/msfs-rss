    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Drzewiecki Designs has recently released his latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator, being KBFI Boeing Field in Seattle. This is Drzewieckiâs third Seattle-area scenery, following the release of Paine Field and Renton. All three of these airports serve as sites for production or delivery of Boeingâs lines of aircraft.  Boeing Field, officially known as King County International Airport, is situated five miles south of downtown Seattle. It served as Seattleâs main passenger gateway, until the larger Seattle-Tacoma Airport opened in 1944. It was crucial in the production of many early 737 series of aircraft in the 1960âs, due to the fact that Boeingâs other narrowbody production facility at Renton didnât have enough capacity. Today, it mainly serves as a cargo airport, and is the site of the Boeing Delivery Center, where new 737âs are delivered after going through final preparation. The Drzewiecki Designs rendition of the airport has many features, including: As of the time of writing, you can get this airport on the Aerosoft store, but that will expand to other vendors shortly. â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news and reviews on the latest in flight simulation!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Axonos have just recently released their rendition of the famous high-altitude airport, Jackson Hole, for X-Plane 12. Situated in the rocky mountains, Jackson Hole Airport is a popular destination for those looking to explore the Rockies! Jackson Hole Airport was originally created in the 1930âs, and it was chosen for its advantageous location within Teton County. The airport was declared a National Monument in 1943, and eventually merged with the Grand Teton National Park in 1950. Jackson Hole is the only commercial airport in the United States to be part of a National Park. The runway was extended to its current length of 6300 feet in 1959. The original Frontier Airlines was the first airline to serve Jackson Hole, with flights to Salt Lake City, Denver, and Billings using Douglas DC-3âs and eventually Boeing 737-200âs. The terminal was completely rebuilt between 2009 and 2014.  Today, the airport is the busiest airport in Wyoming, seeing over 450,000 passengers per year. It has nonstop service to 15 destinations during peak seasonal times by 8 different airlines, and has year-round service by Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. It is the main destination for many ski resorts surrounding the airport. Axonosâ rendition of the airport includes many features, such as: You can add this airport to your virtual world for $22.99 from their store. â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news and reviews on the latest in flight simulation!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has taken to their website and Facebook to provide a comprehensive update on all projects expected for release next year. The news bulletin covers all projects, indicating that Just Flight has almost every corner of the aviation market covered for the coming year. From general aviation to heavy airliners, it is evident that next year will be a busy one for Just Flight. The team has outlined a list of aircraft in production, all slated for release in the upcoming year. Starting with the highly-anticipated release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Just Flight vows to commit to ensuring product compatibility and development for Asobo's upcoming simulator. Airliner projects were thoroughly covered with updates and new previews, such as the A300B4 Professional, which was revealed at FS Expo last year. The team is diligently working on finishing the extensive texturing of the flight deck and exterior model, paying attention to every imaginable detail, including a reworked modeling of the nose section of the aircraft. System coding has made significant progress, with the completion of the electrical, air bleed, air conditioning, pressurization, APU, and fuel systems. These systems, like their real-life counterparts, will respond to environmental factors. Progress is ongoing, with the team aiming to provide every detail, down to individual weathered texturing for screw heads. Updates don't stop with the A300, as the RJ Professional is next in line to be released. Just Flight reports significant progress in coding and systems completion, highlighting new systems matching differences between the older 146 and the more modern RJ. Visually, the RJ will feature a high-density 3+3 layout with a full range of animations and sounds. A preview of the cabin is provided below.  The F70/100 Professional is also making progress, with a current focus on reworked texturing from new reference photographs, ensuring an unprecedented level of detail. Various details, such as certain switches and knobs, have been remodeled. The progress continues with animations, lighting, and systems integration.  Finally, an update to the 146 Professional is expected early next year, including the UNS-1 FMS and a reworked detailed cabin from the RJ Professional. This update is currently under beta testing, with more information expected closer to release. Furthermore, the Blue Bird Simulations' 757 is still scheduled for next year, with Just Flight stating that the team is "also incredibly busy" working on the "flying pencil." Just Flight covered general aviation projects, starting with the Piston and Turbine Duke by Black Square, nearing completion. Thandra Designs will collaborate with Just Flight to update their X-Plane 11 fleet to X-Plane 12 standards, utilizing all available features of the simulator. The Duchess, being the first on XP12 list, will feature 8k textures and modern texturing effects inside out. Animations will also be reworked, with reactive animations responding to G-forces and air resistance. Additionally, Just Flightâs new EFB will make it to the X-Plane 12 model, providing controls over airframe features. This update aims to breathe new life into the X-Plane version of the Duchess. Not all projects are progressing as well as hoped, with the Tomahawk project facing setbacks. Just Flight stated that the Tomahawk project stalled but is now at the center of their attention, bringing it in line for their next GA aircraft release for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The in-house team is working on upgrading the interior and exterior modeling and texturing, as well as systems. Expect fully functional avionics stacks, including the GMA340, SL20, SL40, the GX28 transponder, as well as GPS options. On the military side, Just Flightâs Tornado GR1 for MSFS is also making progress. The "Tonka" is being worked on by the same team that brought us the incredibly detailed Avro Vulcan. The same level of detail and passion is being applied to the Tornado. The team has remodeled many parts of the aircraft to bring higher detail and accuracy, with texturing receiving highly detailed 8k treatment as well. Coding is next on the team's list. The Tornado team will be tasked with transferring the Hi-Fi code from the Prepar3D Tornado to MSFS. During the transfer, new features and improvements will be added to bring as much operational accuracy to the real aircraft as possible. Also, Expect 24 paint schemes to be released with the Tornado. Just Flight is wrapping up and preparing for a busy 2024 for the flight sim community, with releases covering all spans of aviation. They express gratitude to the community for its support throughout 2023 and wish everyone a "Very Merry Christmas and health and happiness in the New Year."
