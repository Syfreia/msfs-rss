    <summary>Sim: MSFS. As their name suggests, UK2000 have previously exclusively developed sceneries located in the United Kingdom for various simulators. However, the developer is taking a different path with the announcement of John Wayne Airport (KSNA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This airport marks the first scenery by the developer located outside of the United Kingdom, as well as their first scenery located in America. Citing the reason for the switch as âpart business and part getting bored with UK airports,â the developer has stated that their venture into the American scene brings a âleap forward in improved HD PBR materials and Level of Detail for UK2000.â According to the developer, KSNA is also set to include a plethora of accurately placed custom-made models created in an efficient way to limit file size, and line markings with âblack-bordersâ typically seen in the United States have been included. As well, UK2000 has remodeled their general aviation library collection to include additional details with PBR materials. Furthermore, new models have been added, such as the C172, SR22, P-51, and B17 for the airport museum. Additionally, the airside terminal interior has been modelled, along with â21 unique animated Jetways with high PBR details.â Unfortunately, no further information was provided, and no release date or pricing information is known. However, it was stated that release is due soon so Threshold will make sure to keep you updated on any developments that arise with this airport. In the meantime, make sure to check out the official trailer for KSNA via UK2000 Sceneryâs YouTube Channel.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Scenery developer Xometry is expanding into the MSFS2020 environment, as they've previewed their Victorville rendition in the new simulator. The upgraded scenery will be their first for the sim, and it surely won't be the last. Conveniently, VCV was their first airport in X-Plane 11, and it appears that Xometry is continuing that theme.Â  Victorville is a local legend among AvGeeks and aviation nerds in the Pacific Southwest. Famous for its vast graveyard containing hundreds of stored airline relics, the played a significant role in keeping aircraft during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fleets such as the Aero California DC-9s, Delta MD-80, MD90, and FedEx DC-10s have found their permanent home in the lower desert.Â  Unfortunately, the Xometry team hasn't provided an MSFS-specific feature list, so we'll give you their X-Plane 11 features: We'll keep you updated when Xometry posts additional information regarding the upcoming scenery.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aircraft developer Rotate has announced the release date of their upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-11 for X-Plane 11Â via X-Plane.org's YouTube channel.Â The hyped trijet will release on March 24th. This release marks the first-ever high-quality heavy trijet in X-Plane 11. Since the project was initially announced in May of 2017, nearly five years have passed while the community has eagerly awaited its release. As mentioned before, MD-11 is the first quality heavy trijet that the X-Plane 11 community has ever seen. Complimenting this fact is the lack of high-caliber heavy trijets in any sim, as the CaptainSim L1011 TriStar exists as the last notable 3-engined model. Preceding the CaptainSim L1011, the PMDG MD-11 and JustFlight DC-10 were developed originally for 32bit platforms such as FSX.Â  Rotate has distributed some preview copies to streamers for usage in anticipation of the release. Q8Pilot is currently active on the YouTube platform, showcasing the aircraft in its full glory.Â Check out his channel to learn more about the upcoming release. Last but not least is the pricing of the MD-11; unfortunately, neither Rotate nor X-Plane.org have provided a specific figure as to how much the plane will cost, though it was mentioned in the comments of theÂ release trailerÂ that pilots could expect the trijet to be in the 80-90USD range.Â  â a special thank you to "Hampus Murling" on Discord for providing these screenshots of the MD-11!</summary>

KSDF also features a passenger terminal which in 2019, serviced about 4.2 million passengers from carriers such as Delta, Southwest, American, and many other carriers. â No feature list has been provided by ZDP, however at a eye glance, detailed ground textures and 3D buildings are all provided in this package. From the included screenshots, the airport seems to be WorldTraffic 3 compatible, alongside a possible SAMÂ Jetway extension for movable jetways.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Following the announcement of the release date on Tuesday, Rotate has delivered upon their promise and has launched their MD-11 for X-Plane. The MD-11 has been Rotate's active development project since its announcement in May 2017, almost 5 years ago. The aircraft accurately depicts its real life counterpart, currently only simulating the General Electric (GE)Â engine option in the freighter variant. Rotate has been sharing teasers and system previews of the widebody tri-jet frequently since it first announced the aircraft aircraft, mainly focussing on individual system areas during these updates. Nearing the end of the development process, the aircraft subsequently entered beta testing in late October of 2021. Following this long test period, the developer shared the aircraft with media outlets and streamers over the past weeks ahead of today's release.  Rotate has shared an extensive feature list on the product page, although the full thing is too long to share on this article, highlights of this include over 200 custom failures, and accurate simulation of all critical aircraft systems. Rotate has also announced today, prompting lots of backlash that the aircraft will see the passenger variant as an extra purchase. Seeing as the aircraft also does not ship with the Pratt and Whitney engines, and has lots of small bugs degrading the experience, the community is seemingly disappointed. You can purchase the highly awaited Rotate MD-11 for X-Plane 11 now from the X-Plane.org Store for $83.95.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The team over at Xometry Design is back bringing Victorville Logistics Airport to Microsoft Flight Simulator. This release brings the developers both attention to detail, and quality work to the Southern California Logistics Airport. The Victorville Airport is known for a variety of subjects, most recently being used as a aircraft storage and an aircraft retirement area. At its inception, the USÂ Federal Government was trying to situate the area after the closure of George Air Force Base, once coming to a conclusion, the airport was convereted to a Logistics Airport in 1992. Since then, the airfield has been used for cargo and airline logistics and storage. In 2020, as a result with of the COVID-19 Pandemic, many airlines both housed in the USÂ and outside the US, use this airfield for aircraft storage due to lesser demand on routes. Xometry has provided a detailed feature log upon release of this package. Starting off, detailed buildings and ground textures have been modelled with PBRÂ textures. Xometry has provided both a pre COVID and current renditions fo the airport. Disassembled aircraft parts can be found across the airfield, with including over 150 custom placed aircraft over the airport grounds. If you are interested in the full feature list, you can check out the products webpage. If you are interested in this scenery package and picking it up for yourself, you can purchase it over on the iniBuilds Store and sells for $17.00 USD. If you are interested in any other products by Xometry, you can check out their extensive catalog on the iniBuilds Store as well.</summary>
