    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Jeju International Airport (RKPC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in South Korea with a yearly average of 31.3 million passengers.  Built as Jeju Airfield during the Japanese colonial period by the hands of enslaved Jeju locals, then taken over by the US Army after World War 2 and used by the Korean government as an extermination field during the uprising, where an estimated 700 Jeju citizens were shot to death (known in South Korea as the April 3 massacre, or Jeju uprising. The total death toll surpasses 30,000) and buried. Only 237 of the bodies were found during a full-scale excavation in 2007.  The airport was built in the late 1960s as part of a governmental effort to develop the islandâs tourism. It was inaugurated in 1968 with a 1,200-meter runway and a modestly sized terminal, initially aimed at domestic operations. Expansion work was only conducted in the 80s and 90s, lengthening the runway and upgrading the terminal facilities to accommodate larger aircraft and more passenger traffic. â The international status was granted in 2002 with the construction of an international terminal, kickstarting a massive growth in passenger traffic (from a 9 million/year average to almost 20 million within a decade). The numbers peaked in 2019 at 31 million passengers.  Itâs a hub for Jeju Air and a focus city for Air Busan, Asiana Airlines, Eastar Jet, Jin Air, Korean Air, and Tâway Air. Visitors include China Eastern, China Southern, HK Express, Scoot, Spring Airlines, and Tigerair Taiwan.Â  â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, highly-detailed models, performance-friendly optimization, and an official GSX profile.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $21.88, requiring at least 8.21 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The return of a classic, MicroProse announces, Falcon 5.0 after requiring the Falcon brand. Recently, MicroProse announced the successor to the Falcon series, Falcon 5.0. The Falcon series was one of the most sophisticated combat simulators of its time. Falcon 4.0 was released over 25 years ago and focused on a detailed, accurate simulation of the F-16 Falcon. Some rated it as close to 90% system accuracy. MicroProse was ahead of its time by coding the complexity of the "Vipers" flight systems, avionics, flight characteristics, and PvE AI combat. The simulator campaign is based on a South Korean/North Korean conflict with allied forces such as the United States providing military support and aiding South Korean defenses against invading North Korean aggression. You take on the role of a Viper Pilot under the United States Air Force. You are tasked with air-to-ground bombing runs, holding air space superiority, and more. â Starting with training, learn the nitty-gritty of jet combat and F16-specific combat maneuvers amidst dogfight scenarios. Learn armed tactics, weapon behaviors, and characteristics through 30 training missions. I wouldn't skip over them! Ahead of its time was a pilot rating system based on detailed kill reports and kill quality. The player's kills and actions directly affect the path of the game as well. In addition, Falcon 4.0 supported online multiplayer PVP dogfights, incredible for its time. Falcon 4.0 claimed some of the best reviews of any combat flight simulator for its time. The simulator reaches back to 1987, with Falcon 4.0 Allied Force as the most recent iteration. June 2005.  Hopefully, MicroProse will give us that ringed flight ops manual. â Â â PC-Pilot Magazine's Derek Davis interviews David Laettie of MicroProse covering the push and goal to get Micropose back into Flight Simulation. The interview has exclusive screenshots of a new aircraft addition to the Viper's simulation. Derek Davis also inquired about other flight simulation projects during the interview. Access to the article and exclusive cockpit shots of both aircraft can be viewed on PC-Pilot with a subscription.  â Falcon is still alive at the hands of Benchmark Sims Team akaBMS . BMS has worked to keep the title current with today's technology and modern software capabilities. MicroProse thanked the team for keeping the simulation alive through the years. It looks like an exciting acknowledgment and upcoming teamwork to bring the best out of Falcon 5! Benchmark Sims Team announced on Twitter that they have resolved the intellectual property subject with Falcon 4.0 and will continue development with minimal disruption. A highlighted version of the contractual agreement can be found on BMS's forum post.  â â Falcon 5.0 is expected to be on the markets before the holiday season.  â Stay tuned and expect more from Threshold for more information covering this evolving project! â  â  â  â â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their newest scenery pack for Microsoft Flight Simulator, including three challenging airstrips in Idaho and a bonus makeshift helicopter area with a STOL landing zone.  The âDeadly 3â are three famous - and challenging - strips in Idaho, known for requiring a lot of technique to get the landings right. Dewey Moore, Simonds, and Vines Airstrip are as barebones as a landing strip can get, with no basic infrastructure, making it ideal for hardcore camping. â Dewey Moore, the first of the airstrips, is located on the north side of Big Creek, 19 miles west of the junction of Big Creek and the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, with a 700 ft long gravel runway at 4,494 feet above sea level. Itâs recommended for highly experienced mountain pilots only (in real life). â Simonds is a very difficult airstrip located on Monumental Creek, close to where it joins up with Big Creek. Itâs often used for guided hunting trips and has no infrastructure, meaning pilots should bring tie-downs and camping equipment. It has a 900 ft long gravel runway, and pilots are instructed to watch for traffic from the nearby Monumental Ranch private airstrip. â Vines Airstrip is located on the south side of Big Creek Canyon, two miles west of Cabin Creek Airstrip, close to where Big Creek joins into the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. Itâs a 1,100 ft gravel strip at 4,110 feet above sea level, and pilots are instructed to land on runway 27 and take off from runway 9. Real-life recommendations include instructions on short field operations, and pilots are generally advised to follow Big Creek to avoid trees on final approach and watch their airspeed very carefully as a 10 percent increase in approach speed means a 21% increase in landing distance.Â  â The three strips are a short flight away fromÂ 85U Soldier BarÂ andÂ McCall Municipal AirportÂ (KMYL), both developed by Milo Taylor, the author of Idahoâs Deadly 3. His new creation features substantial terraforming work, custom animations, custom vegetation, and much more. The complete feature list for the package follows below:  â â Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $12.91, requiring at least 697.99 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aeroplane Heaven has made an announcement regarding the development of their upcoming Avro Lancaster for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The Lancaster project was originally announced back in 2022, it has been a main focus for the company since the release of their DC-3 for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th anniversary update.Â  â â â The Avro Lancaster was a highly significant aircraft developed for the RAF during World War Two. It proudly served not only the Royal Air Force but also the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force. The Lancaster was designed with a spacious bomb bay, allowing it to accommodate the largest bombs utilized by the RAF. It is most notable for its pivotal role in Operation Chastise, better known as the Dam Busters raid. In this operation, British flight crews skillfully dropped cylindrical-shaped bombs, ingeniously spinning them before release, to have the bombs skip across the water to effectively destroy the MÃ¶hne and Edersee dams. â â The development update, which was posted to Aeroplane Heaven's Facebook page, states that the modeling and textures are nearing completion, however, there's been no announcement regarding a release date other than that it's expected to be released in the second half of 2023. Aeroplane Heaven has stated they're also working on "some cool coding ideas to bring extra functionality" to the aircraft, though it hasn't been announced what these extra functionalities may include. Aeroplane Heaven has also hinted at the possibility of additional model variants (Mk I, Mk III, etc.) if "time allows". The developer has however confirmed that the aircraft will include custom flight crew models that feature period-correct uniforms and equipment.Â  â â Threshold is excited to bring you this and other updates for your favorite simulators! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Burning Blue Design has recently released their rendition of H. A. Clark Memorial Field (KCMR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a public-use general aviation airport in Williams, Arizona, with a yearly average of 16,100 operations. â It was built in 1925 as Webber Field, yet left to deteriorate during its initial years until the advent of the Civilian Pilot Training Program in 1939, which helped to rekindle the interest in aviation in Williams. On the other hand, the airfield's development predated the increased interest, with work starting in 1935, followed by a further $140000 investment in 1940 from the Civil Aeronautics Board. â The many upgrades eventually drew the attention of the US Army, which used the field from 1942 to train cadets. Seven army instructors were stationed there during that period, training 30 people. â Its 1,830-meter-long runway might seem long, but the aerodromeâs elevation (6,691ft) makes it somewhat challenging.Â Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airfield, with over 120 custom objects, accurate taxiways, a high-detail terminal building interior, detailed hangars with interiors, custom flags and windsocks, custom night lighting, and color-corrected ground textures.  Itâs available on Burning Blue DesignâsÂ websiteÂ for roughly $13.78. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their rendition of Seattle Paine Field International Airport (KPAE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Snohomish County, Washington, with a yearly average of 377,000 passengers.  The airport was built in 1936 as a Works Program Administration project, envisioned as a job creator, economic booster in the region, and one of the future âsuper airportsâ in the United States. â It was taken over by the Army during World War 2, only to be transferred back to Snohomish County in 1948, with the Air Force still maintaining various Air Defense Command units at the airport as military tenants. â The âsuper airportâ plans were revived briefly because the Korean War forced the airport to become an air force base. It was only returned to civilian use in the 1960s.  â Boeing chose Paine Field as the construction and testing site for their Boeing 747 project in 1966, where it also made its first landing three years later. â After years of debate about using the airport for commercial service, they finally reached an agreement, with a passenger terminal being constructed in 2017, featuring 30,000 square meters of area, two gates, and the ability to handle up to 16 flights a day. â Itâs served by Alaska Airlines (Anchorage, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Orange County, PhoenixâSky Harbor, San Diego, San Francisco) and Kenmore Air (Eastsound, Friday Harbor, Victoria). â â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with the Boeing factory and their 777X production line (fully animated), performance-friendly optimization, custom animated people and vehicles, GSX Pro compatibility (using Cartayna files), modeled interiors, custom jetways, and more. â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $24.86, requiring at least 1.40 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>iniBuilds Releases Honolulu International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (PHNL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Hawaiian city of Honolulu with a yearly average of 18.3 million passengers.  It opened in March 1927 as John Rodgers Airport, after a WW1 naval officer. It was the first full airport in Hawaii, as they only had landing strips, fields, and seaplane docks beforehand. â After Pearl Harbor, the airport became Naval Air Station Honolulu, with a control tower built by the Navy, a terminal building, and passenger traffic was even allowed during daylight hours. It was returned right after the war, in 1946.Â  â It was renamed âHonolulu Airportâ in 1947 and internationalized in 1951. It became an important stop for many transpacific flights, rapidly becoming one of the busiest airports in the United States. It even had the longest runway in the world (back in 1953), at a then-impressive 3,992 meters.  The original terminal was replaced by a new one in 1962, which was eventually modernized in the 70s by Vladimir Ossipoff, who entirely remodeled the terminal and added new concourses.  In the early 2000s, Ossipoffâs modern terminal was not so modern anymore, and the âforward-lookingâ and flexible design was showing its age, facing the challenges of the modern standards of accessibility, comfort, and security. In response, the government unveiled a 2.3 billion USD modernization program for all Hawaiian airports over 12 years, with 1.7 billion for Honolulu alone.  Many infrastructure upgrades were made during that period, and a new concourse was built between 2018-2021, featuring gates that can easily accommodate widebody jets, making life easier for Hawaiian Airlines passengers that will no longer have to walk between terminals for overseas departures.  The current layout sports three terminals, with 54 jetways and six stands. Terminal 1 has 25 jetways, 2 has 29, and 3 has parking stands.Â   Itâs a hub for Aloha Air Cargo, Asia Pacific Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Mokulele Airlines, Transair, and Corporate Air. The visitorsâ list includes Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Fiji Airways, Japan Airlines, Jetstar, Korean Air, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, WestJet, and Zipair Tokyo. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, Â hand-made textures, high-quality surrounding POIs, true-to-life landside recreation, an official GSX profile, dynamic lighting, and a detailed terminal interior.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $25.17, requiring at least 5.36 GB of free hard disk space. 10% of all revenue will be donated to the American Red Cross for the Hawaiian Wildfire crisis.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
