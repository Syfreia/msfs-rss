    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Lamezia Terme International Airport (LICA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the principal airport of Calabria, with a yearly average of 3 million passengers. Regularly visited by ITA, Ryanair, Edelweiss, easyJet, and WizzAir, the traffic peaks during the summer, where other airlines also fly down to Calabria, such as Air Transat, Austrian, Condor, Eurowings, Finnair, Smartwings and Transavia.Â   The airport opened in June 1976, with the first modernization and expansion happening in 1982. Recently, the runway was extended from the original 2,414 meters to 3,017 meters. In 2008, Engco won a competition to design a newÂ passenger terminal, aiming to expand the limited capacity of the old one, which grew unable to handle such volume. The idea was to build the new one while progressively demolishing the old terminal, keeping both functioning simultaneously until the progress was finally complete. Due to lack of funding, the plans never came to fruition.Â   The scenery features a detailed representation of the entire airport area, with an up-to-date layout (as of October 2022) featuring the new extended apron and the runway extension, custom static aircraft (an AB 412 and a Canadair CL-415 that operate at the airport), projected mesh groundpoly, custom GSE and clutter, an animated radar, and custom taxi signs and approach lighting.Â   Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $16.49, requiring at least 2.79 GB of free disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flight Sim Development Group has just released their rendition of Bremen Airport (EDDW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city and state of Bremen in Northern Germany with a yearly average of 2.5 million passengers. The route network is mostly intra-european, served by airlines such as Corendon, Eurowings, KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SundAir, Turkish, and WizzAir.Â   The airport was built in the early 1900s, when a local aerospace club ran a couple experimental flights at the site that would then become Bremen Airport. It was then transformed into a military airport during WW1, with a reopening in 1920, when KLM had a scheduled flight to Amsterdam. In the 1930s, it was repurposed as military airfield, serving as a training base for the Luftwaffe, housing a squadron of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 bombers between late-1939 and mid-1940. It was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed, repaired in 1945, when the US Army took over and repurposed it as an airbase, only to be handed back in 1949.  The scenery features an accurate representation of Bremen Airport, with fully customized vehicles and facilities, realistic light environment and interior modeling, seasonal changes, reflective textures, compatible with GSX and Landmarks of Germany, including a custom GSX profile and a user manual.  Itâs available onÂ FSDGâs StoreÂ for roughly $23.35.Â  Shout out to Tang0 for the scoop! Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Sierrasim Simulation has just released their rendition of Antonio NariÃ±o Airport (SKPS) for X-Plane 11 and 12, located in ChachagÃ¼Ã­ (Colombia) and serving the city of Pasto (popularly known as Pasto Airport). With its table top runway built on a plateau and an elevation of 5,951 feet with only 2,312 meters of runway length, one of the trickiest approaches in Colombia. It is often rendered useless during certain days because of crosswinds that make takeoff and arrivals an impossible - and unsafe - task, especially in August.Â   The visitor's list includes Avianca and Latam Colombia, with routes to BogotÃ¡ and Cali, EasyFly to Cali, and Viva Air Colombia to Cartagena and MedellÃ­n. The overall figure amounts to 330,000 passengers yearly (as of 2019).Â   The scenery features textures and models based on aerial imagery, photo-realistic PBR textures for buildings and vehicles, orthophoto, sloped runway, performance-focused optimization, and more. The complete feature list follows down below:  Itâs available on SimMarket for $11.39, requiring at least 774 MB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has just released their rendition of Bratislava Airport (LZIB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the main international airport of Slovakia, with a yearly average of 2.2 million passengers. Its slovak name (Letisko M. R. Å tefÃ¡nika) is after general Milan Rastislav Å tefÃ¡nik, victim of an airplane accident in 1919.Â   Due to its proximity to Vienna International Airport (LOWW), itâs often considered a cheaper alternative by LCCs. Itâs the hub for AirExplore and an important city for Ryanair, Smartwings, and Wizzair. Traffic gets busier during the summer, when seasonal charters take people to coastal cities like BraÄ and Antalya.Â   The scenery features aerial imagery covering the airport surroundings, optimized 3D objects, detailed passenger terminal interior, animated passengers inside the airport and in the vicinity, true-to-life logistic parks and delivery centers, and more. The complete feature list follows down below: â  Itâs available on theÂ Aerosoft ShopÂ for $16.99, requiring at least 5 GB of free disk space to install.
