    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Various previews and trailers have been dropping thick and fast by Laminar Research over the past few days, with previews being shared of various aircraft within the simulator environment. Three of the four videos shared have been shared by Michael Brown, who is a close affiliate of Austin Meyer, but not directly involved with simulator development. Brown is also the owner of X-Force PC, another company with close ties to Laminar. The final video shared is an official trailer of the Cirrus SR-22, produced for Laminar Research by Aviation Lads, a flight simulation promotional content creator. Below is a summary of each video shared by Michael Brown, including a detailed breakdown of the snow and ice featured in the A330 preview video. The video first starts off with Austin showing off his personal aircraft, the Lancair Evolution, which has been integrated into the current Alpha build of X-Plane 12. The aircraft will be shipped as an included GA aircraft when the simulator is released to the public. The video demonstrates the various new additions that X-Plane 12 offers, whilst taking a look at the exterior of the aircraft, viewers can take notice of the ice patches on the runway and the new volumetric clouds. Austin then showcases the cockpit of the Lancair and all of the airframe unique features he has implemented in the real world aircraft, which has then been translated into the simulator. Austin rounds off his showcase of the aircraft by showcasing the simulatorâs new volumetric lighting engine, thoroughly explaining what has been done and what is currently being done to make it smooth and flow as best as possible whilst climbing and descending. He then goes on to show the speed, and agility of the Lancair Evolution and explains why this GA aircraft is different from all others. Similar to the video featuring the Lancair Meyer, this video starts off with no delay and jumps directly into discussing runway icing conditions. According to Austin, the ice behaves as ice would naturally behave in reality. As temperatures climb, ice will turn to puddles and as temperatures drop below freezing, puddles turn to ice. While this may sound elementary, having this visually modelled and represented is unheard of. Briefly touching on a major detail that Austin vaguely mentioned, but we couldn't help but notice, was the taxiway and runway textures, which certainly are an improvement from X-Plane 11, to say the least. From ice to A330, Austin is quick to change topics and begins sharing his thoughts on their new default A330. His excitement is almost tangible and rightfully so, the aircraft looks fantastic. Giving praise to the artist responsible for the texture work, he highlights the intricacy in the textures and modelling, in particular the bump maps. Austin also discusses the depth of the systems in the aircraft, which appear to exceed the normal level of detail in X-Plane default aircraft. Â An interesting aspect of the aircraft which was extensively discussed in the video was the âEagle Clawâ landing gear. Austin outlined the physics behind the shock absorption mechanics, explaining that the aircraft will simulate the softening effects that this landing gear design has on touchdown. While discussing the mechanics behind the landing gear, Austin is quick to reassure current users that the flight dynamics, which X-Plane is renowned for, are still the forefront of the team's focus and are not by any means traded for better visuals. As the video continues we get a glimpse of some magnificent sights X-Plane 12 holds such as the new 3D clouds, which Austin stresses are still a work in progress. Even more importantly, a highly discussed yet grey area in the X-Plane community for years was addressed, Austin mentioned he had put a team together in Eastern Europe to work specifically on scenery textures. I know hearing this will bring tears of joy to many current users, with the current versions of X-Plane being majorly shadowed by poor ground texturing by default. As we enter the last quarter of the video, the discussion focuses back on the flight dynamics of the A330 itself. For those who enjoy commanding heavy metal aircraft, be rest assured the aircraft behaves accordingly. With the restricted bank angels, sluggish reaction times and the almost untameable momentum, Austin makes it clear that no detail was missed in this respect. The video ends with a bang, which is a polite way to describe the landing, with Austin perfectly displaying the undivided attention such an aircraft requires, coming in at 300 Knots on final and overshooting. We know this is by no means a display of Austin's piloting skills, but rather a perfect example that this aircraft is no paper plane, and requires one's full undivided attention. Check out the video on A330 and everything icing below: The last video to be shared on Michael Brownâs channel is Austin âshowcasingâ the new F-14 Tomcat. The showcase features Austin taking the Tomcat out of New Yorkâs JFK airport with full afterburners, followed by a swift climb to an altitude where the sunrise can be witnessed in its full glory. Austin then follows this by demonstrating the famous wing sweep of the aircraft and the full flight dynamics being modelled during different stages of the wing sweep. A quick aero refuelling is completed (within the X-Plane menus) after running out of fuel by running full afterburners, then video turns to Austin demonstrating a carrier landing. While the landing was rather impressive, the approach was less graceful with a steep descent from a high altitude being completed using full speed brakes, flaps as well as extended gear. The carrier landing also showcased the fully functional landing hook modelled on the aircraft. While the actual aircraft carrier in the video is the default one from X-Plane, Austin mentioned that a new one is being worked on for X-Plane 12, with a visual artist currently working on the asset, which will greatly improve the visual environment within the when flying over water bodies. Fancy exploring the F-14 Tomcat in more detail? The video below is the one for you: This summary of all developments is rounded off by Laminar Researchâs official trailer of the new default Cirrus SR22. While not designed to compete with products such as Torquesimâs Take Command! series of Cirrus aircraft, the aircraft will most certainly be a welcome addition to the simulator. The video, edited together by Aviation Lads, runs in the format of a cinematic completion of a full flight in California taking in famous signs such as the Hollywood sign. The video also demonstrates various capabilities of the simulator itself such as the new rain and icing effects on the windshield. The aircraft itself seems to have a good level of systems modelled including the standard G1000 unit as well as an oxygen system, demonstrated in the video by the aircraft climbing to an altitude of FL150. Sounds are also demonstrated, where a high-quality sound set has been implemented for the aircraft, hopefully being ported to aircraft like the default Cessna 172, setting a higher standard within the simulator. Of course, the gorgeous new weather system is demonstrated as well such as in the screenshot above. Many different weather cycles were shown such as towering clouds, rain and icing conditions. Find all of the above mentioned in the official trailer below: Towards the end of the video where Austin is showcasing his Lancair Meyer, he briefly touches on the current status of X-Plane 12. He stated that there are about 100 current testers, 20 of whom are in direct contact with him. He also stated that work is hoping to be completed on the road network of X-Plane 12 and updates on coastline texturing. Austin addressed hopes for an Open Beta soon, but no date was given or specified as of today. Thatâs all for this weekâs exciting spell of X-Plane 12 previews, check back on Threshold regularly to make sure you never miss the latest updates on the newest generation of the simulator.</summary>

    <title>PMDG Says 737 NG3 Has Entered Beta</title>
    <updated>2022-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/73ngbt" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6209b16078b45f2be1a2d595_image_15297.jpeg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="1049348"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. News of the 737 NG3 has been pouring in for much of 2022 as PMDG gears up for a blockbuster release with the teamâs head Robert Randazzo once again returned to the forums with another iterative weather update on the progression of the 737 NG3 for MSFS. The announcement broke the news that the series of products is now entering beta testing, the decision being made last Thursday with the state of the add-on âmostly conforming to the final productâ. Priorities remain the same, though this week introduces further refinements to the 3D including the HUD and HGS rendering, scaling adjustments across the visual model, shadow models and visual refinements to the ground service vehicles. The technical side of things includes the introduction of TCAS II v7.2 for both online and offline traffic, increased pushback accuracy and validation work on equipment and hardware. See here for the breakdown from the forum post: Randazzo elaborated saying that much of the work revolves around polishing the aircraft, which the aircraft is at a stage where the team has addressed most of the msfs related issues and effort is now being streamed into "platform-PMDG issues", issues that stem from the teamâs lack of familiarity with MSFS. Two screenshots were provided, demonstrating the collimated HUD and the graphical prowess of the simulator. For the HUD, Randazzo promoted that it âworks well both in daylight and in night modesâ, with support for variable dimming and flying modes normally used in flight: In the same respect as their previous DC-6 release, the lighting was all done from the ground up to take advantage of MSFSâs lighting system. The second image showcases the light flare as the sun shines against the glistening metal skin of the fuselage and wings. Subtle creases reflecting the surrounding environment are also visible from the picture: Randazzo then moves to address questions raised about the performance, which he provided an indefinite answer given that the aircraft and the equipment used in development wouldnât accurately reflect the use-cases for the end user. The general consensus is that the performance is largely in line with other aircraft offerings. The development build lacks the optimisation effort which wouldnât provide usable FPS numbers and it includes development tools attached such as a debugger. Once the testers delves into the beta copy, Randazzo would be able to supply more concrete numbers.Â  Randazzo also intends to follow up on this post with a demo video, with the intent to showcase features such as the collimated HUD - this week is the goal though Randazzo is wishful in that regard. That wraps up the development update for the NG3. As usual, Threshold will closely follow the development of the aircraft, stay tuned! Check the original update through their forums.</summary>

    <title>SimCoders Teases X-Plane 12 Plans &amp; Carenado Piper Navajo REP</title>
    <updated>2022-02-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/12nava" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/620b09b2f41e1f31c789b861_wo.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="529061"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Â Last week, X-Plane developer SimCoders published a series of previews depicting their upcoming Reality Expansion Pack (REP) for Carenado Piper Navajo and sharing their plans of bringing their trademark Reality Expansion Packs to X-Plane 12, discussing the full implementation of the experimental flight model currently available as an option in X-Plane 11. For the developers, one of the bigger challenges they have to tackle is the full implementation of the Experimental Flight Model (EFM), an option available to users since X-Plane 11.40 but will become the only model available in X-Plane 12. To facilitate a âsmooth transitionâ to the new flight model, all REP from v4.6 onwards will run the EFM by default. Inn addition, the SimCoders are looking to âimprove the flight dynamics of the older REPsâ (Carenado F33, V35, Baron, C210, etc) based on community feedback, presenting users with the most realistic flight experience. Apart from the insights on their transition to the new simulator, the developers also teased the community with progress on their upcoming Navajo REP. The pictures showcase the aircrafts checklist, load/balance, and airspeed reference sheet. The plugin, according to the developers, will feature âall the usual REP improvements and a couple of powerful Lycoming TSIO-540-A2Câ. However, it is difficult to judge how close the REP is to completion based on the pictures provided. Currently, SimCoders is yet to announce a release date or pricing for the Carenado Navajo Reality Pack. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. For those looking to purchase existing Reality Expansion Packs, all SimCoders products can be found on the X-Plane.org store.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. VATSIMâs team is maintaining its biannual tradition of Cross the Pond. The event will take place on April 2nd, in the westbound fashion. For those unfamiliar with the event, VATSIM hosts a transatlantic event where hundreds of pilots and full ATC coverage come together to participate in long-haul operations. Nearly 12 hours of full Air Traffic Control services will be in use for the entirety of the event. The team has opened up a vote for pilots to give feedback as to which airports theyâd like to operate out of during the event.Â  As always, thereâs a plethora of airports to choose from. Pilotâs are given the opportunity to choose three of their preferred airports from the lists below.Â  Itâs critical to mention that aspiring CTP pilots must book a flight slot to ensure participation in the event. Whilst bookings are currently not available, the VATSIM team will keep the community updated regarding the results and booking availability later this month. Due to the large swarms of aircraft during the event, pilots can potentially expect delays to their slot times. Another small piece of information to add, is that Concordes are not permitted within the event and supersonic aircraft will not be recognized as event participating aircraft. Stay tuned with VATSIMâs Cross the Pond website to ensure up to date information regarding slot bookings, and event updates.</summary>

    <title>TFDi Announces MD-11 Pricing Details</title>
    <updated>2022-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/md11tf" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/620dbacd1a16115d5de2d91a_ext3.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="1844197"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TFDi has updated their product page for their MD-11 to include pricing information. The team seems to follow the same a-la-carte pricing model of the forthcoming PMDG NG3 which lets users purchase a single aircraft variant of their choice, unlike previous pricing models which includes two or more main variants within the base package. TFDi stated that the pricing model was adopted to allow users to âselect the exact features and options you want.â The base package comes in two flavours, the freighter to passenger variant, purchasing one of them will discount the other base package. For example, if you purchase the passenger variant, you donât need to shell out another $89.99 for the Freighter base package, but $14.99. TFDi aims to also expand the breadth of the simulation with an add-on package labeled âExtended Simulation Packageâ, this package introduces operational failures, an advanced custom failures menu, and some circuit breaker functionality.Here is the original breakdown of the pricing: Other information on the product page promises a well rounded digital replica of the trijet, with support for all the modern ESP (namely, Prepar3D v4 and v5) platforms including MSFS. The team opened the possibility of adapting the aircraft for use on older ESP simulators such as FSX and Prepar3D v1 to 3. The supplied feature list is short but covers what youâd normally expect in a high end aircraft simulation, with a fully bespoke visual model that includes highly accurate 3D and textures, with support for PBR on simulators that support it. On the technical side, accurate flight dynamics, a full fledged onboard simulation system that features a completely simulated FMS and autopilot system simulation are promised. Lastly, the team partnered with Turbine Sound Studios for the soundpack. TFDi is still accepting suggestions in their forum for features people like to see included in the aircraft. Head over to their wishlist to contribute. Thatâs all for TFDiâs MD-11. Weâll be sure to keep you in the loop. For now, do visit their product page for the original source.</summary>

    <title>Magknight Updates Boeing 787</title>
    <updated>2022-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/mag787" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/620dcbdfb40718395f756bb5_Cover.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="53848"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The developers over at Magknight have updated their rendition of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for X-Plane 11, bringing the aircraft version to 1.7.21. This update features many bug fixes and minor feature additions to help prepare the aircraft for its next major update. This is the latest major update to come out, the first in 2022 since August of last year. Since then, the team has been pushing frequent updates in smaller form, through their Cygnus and development-highlights channel. On the coding end, the team has been hard at work preparing for the custom FMC, and Mitchell has been reworking several of the exterior visuals which includes newly modellied wings and wingbox and a fresh set of landing gears - the former which are said to be featured in the next update for the aircraft. The Magknight team has been the sole developer to venture into the world of the Dreamliner in XP11, with FlightFactor shortly becoming their competitor with their 787 currently in development. This update mainly features various bug fixes and minor additions. The CDU help box and NAV RAD page have been added, along with a custom radio simulation. MFD screen pop-ups have been added also with an N1 prediction addition to the EICAS. New Avitab textures, ND graphics,Â  and CDU graphics have been implemented into the aircraft as well. Moving on to items that have been changed, the CDU will now display times in ârealâ UTC. Multiple changes have been made to the MFD, such as keyboard entries, mouse entry code, and movement code, which have all been changed. The PFD artificial horizon colors have been improved alongside screen dimming in the flight deck. Legacy panel art and BetterPushback buttons when the plugin is not installed have been removed in this version. If you are interested in further learning about this update, you can view the full changelog at Magknightâs Official Discord Server. If you are interested in purchasing this aircraft, you can find it on the X-Plane.org Store for $44.95. Threshold will keep you posted on any further updates from Magknight.</summary>

    <title>FlyByWire A32NX Systems Update Progress</title>
    <updated>2022-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fbwsup" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Freeware aircraft developer FlyByWire has published a new community update outlining its future systems development endeavors. Ranging from the Fly-By-Wire systems to the Air Condition system, thereâs a plethora of updates incoming for the A32NX. The team has provided the community with multiple videos to visualize these future updates, and to help pilots understand the functions of these systems.  Many system improvements have been made, such as adjustments to the pitch law, alongside confirming that yaw and roll laws are already realistic. Pitches at lower speeds have also been tweaked making the pitch law more sensitive. Pitch law has also been improved to help compensate for speedbreak deployment and speed changes. With these changes, brings adjustments to the joystick recommended configuration. FBW recommends users to adjust their +/- 30%, which will in turn, help better mimic the increased force needed to go full back or full forward. â In correlation with the Fly-By-Wire system improvements, the autopilot has also received some tweaking. Conditions with arming the ALT and engaging the mechanisms have received several changes. Target load factors to help guide the AP are now seperated for every law that has been previously mentioned and situations. Speed/Mach laws have been improved with what the team refers to as âfurther edge cases''. Vertical speed limitations have also been tweaked for Open Descent and Climb modes. Autoland systems have also been tweaked to include a brand new filter to help recognize the flare law, which will measure vertical speed relative to the ground via radio altimeter. â Moving forward, the Autothrust has received minor tweaking with the involvement of improved transitions between climb, descent, open descent, and open climb modes, which will help keep speeds at -5 or +10 knots on vertical approach. Thrust limits have been improved to help itself and its interaction with CLB limits during flex temp takeoffs.Â  SRS engagement and ATHR arming have been discord to be related, i.e. if SRS does not engage on takeoff, the ATHR will not arm. Lastly, speed control for acceleration and deceleration have been improved to achieve better speed control.  Whilst all of these updates have occurred, FBW has been hard at work developing a new warning system for the aircraft. When released, the Flight Warning Computer (FWC) will help trigger callouts such as GPWS at more accurate heights than before. Other features will include the famous âcricketâ stall noise, and intermediate callouts. â Work on a new AC system has begun. When finished, the cabin will be able to warm and cool with the outside temperatures. Air flow delivery systems have been overhauled to fit into the shoes of its real world counterpart. Users are currently able to try out and are invited to play around these new building blocks for the new AC system. If youâre interested in picking this aircraft up for yourself, you can download it over on FlyByWireâs Website.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. New evidence supports the claim that the Just Flight VC10 for XPlane has been cancelled. In May 2020, Just Flight announced their intentions to port their VC10 from the ESP platform into X-Plane. This was followed by previews uploaded to their Facebook Page: Despite promising images of the teamâs progress, a long radio silence ensued, until XPlane users started to express their concerns online. On February 4th 2022, a user of the XPlane.Org Forums posted an email claimed to have been sent to them by Just Flightâs customer service in response to a query as to the whereabouts of the VC10. The email cites that the main reason for the cancellation of the project was the teamâs inability to assure the quality of the product. This claim is corroborated by the fact that clicking the link to the progress blog on Just Flightâs website yields a âPage not foundâ error. Whilst Just Flight have not yet formally made a public announcement, the evidence points toward the VC-10 port for X-Plane no longer being in development.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The team at Aerobask has uploaded a teaser trailer of their upcoming Diamond DA50 RG for X-Plane 11. Aerobaskâs DA50 features a Garmin avionics suite, PBR textures, and accurate modelling. The new aircraft will join the existing DA62 in the developerâs Diamond catalogue.Â  The Diamond DA50 is a five seat, single engine, composite aircraft designed and manufactured by Diamond Aircraft. Originating out of Austria, the aircraft first flew in April of 2007, but is not in active production awaiting certification from EASA and the FAA. The RG variant of the DA50 has a useful load of 559kg (1,232 lbs), a maximum speed of 181 knots, and a range of 750nm (1,389km). Currently, only two prototypes of the aircraft exist in the entire world, with production expected to resume once its certification process is complete.Â  Unfortunately, Aerobask has not revealed any additional information regarding the whereabouts of the project, but keep an eye out for future teasers and trailers on our website. Pilots who are unfamiliar with Aerobask should take a quick look at this article showcasing Aerobask's rendition of their previous Diamond Aircraft project, the DA62.</summary>

    <title>iniScene Premieres Heathrow Trailer</title>
    <updated>2022-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/inihea" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/621064dbb0efea420ca3a990_neue.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="957243"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The highly awaited trailer for iniSceneâs rendition of London Heathrow Airport has premiered on their YouTube Channel. This trailer comes just after the team announced the project for Microsoft Flight Simulator just a week ago, alongside releasing a teaser trailer the same day. Londonâs Heathrow Airport is often referred to as one of the main International hubs in Europe, alongside airports like Amsterdam Schiphol and Charles De Gualle. It is the hub for the countries residing Flag Carrier, British Airways, while also being a focus airport for Virgin Atlantic. The airport also sees many other well-known carriers such as Delta, KLM, American Airlines, and Emirates to name a few. This project by iniScene has been one of the most ambitious projects for the developer. Not only has the team focused on the main terminals, runways/taxiways, and airport facilities, but they have also focused on many different airport landmarks such as the airport's distinctive looking ATC Control Tower, to construction vehicles on the airport grounds, ending with hotels outside the airport grounds. The team has said that this project will be the team's âmost detailed and feature-rich scenery to date.â No feature list or product page has not been released to the public at this time. Though we do expect to see an intense feature list when it has been made readily available to the public.

    <title> PMDG Publishes 737 For MSFS Preview Trailer</title>
    <updated>2022-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG Simulations has posted a new preview trailer of their 737 for MSFS in action on their YouTube channel. The highly anticipated aircraft has seen some major progress as of late, most recently having entered the beta stage of testing. Similar to its counterpart in Prepar3D, the aircraft will come delivered with every feature as is possible to simulate in MSFS. No release date has been set yet, but the community will be notified of the team's release intentions once the details are concrete.Â  The preview trailer showcases the many views the 737 possesses, presenting the exterior, cockpit, cargo operations, as well as passenger views. Viewers are also able to witness all of the systems in action, as well as the aircraft in a flying state. Itâs imperative to mention, though, that the aircraft is still in active development, therefore systems may be altered from their state in the video. Another subtle but important detail is PMDGâs acknowledgement of MAX development for MSFS. In the description of the video, the author mentions that the product line will âinclude the entire third and fourth generation 737 series from the 737-600 to the 737-10â. No additional details were given as to the development status of the MAX, so ensure that you keep up to date with future articles entailing information about their future products.Â  âAnother Dev Update! Robert Randazzo added to the trailer by posting a new development update. At this point in time, the team is cleaning up the aircraft, bugs are being attended to, and the beta is in full swing. Beta testers are still bound to their Non Disclosure Agreement for the time being, but PMDG expects the testers to be able to share media of the plane in the coming weeks. Luckily, the aircraft is in a better state than expected, which infers a more imminent release.Â  If youâre not caught up with PMDGâs 737 development for MSFS, take a look at this previous article here outlining its beta testing and future progress.</summary>

    <title>A Recap of Flight Factorâs latest 777V2 previews</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlightFactor has been chipping away at several projects, their front-running project being the 777, kickstarting 2022, the team went on a tour with 777v2 updates these past few weeks, dropping several previews and showcasing different aspects and areas of the aircraft. Their latest update takes us to the seat of the cabin, with a rendition that will certainly have you live the exciting moments in a 777: For the bourgeoisie sitting in the forward cabin, FlightFactor has reproduced a highly impressive business class cabin: Emirates undoubtedly has one of the most distinctive and luxurious cabin interiors in the skies; their wooden lacquer window frames and chic cream upholstery serves as a basis for their standard interior modelling amongst a few other options users will be able to choose from. Flight Factor has additionally began modelling some mood lighting across the cabin, shown below: A common argument that frequently appears across all simulation platforms is the idea that cabins are not necessary, and while they don't impact the actual piloting aspect, many enjoy the depth and immersiveness it brings - modern X-Plane airliners all feature a modelled cabin to various degrees of detail. Itâs great to see FlightFactor continue the increasingly popular âcabin cultureâ within X-Plane; no longer will users feel their calming boarding music will be played in vain, now with a cabin to match. On the exterior, FlightFactor has taken a page out of CaptainSim by modelling in operable hatches and service doors across the plane, their most recent example being fully functioning engine cowlings. To date, no other airliner in X-Plane has implemented such a detailed visual model for an airliner. This alone will certainly be a selling point for FlightFactor as it's this type of attention to detail that really touches the buyer's stimulus: Complementing pre-flight inspections, the team has posted a short clip demonstrating animated workers scattered on the apron - bringing some life to the beginning of your flight: Needless to say, this aircraft is generating a lot of noise within the X-Plane community, as it replicates one of the most popular twinjet airliners Boeing has ever made, and is a much-needed replacement to their original product that dates back in X-Plane 9âs final days. For more updates, check out Flight Factorâs Twitter page and be sure to stay tuned, as we will bring you the latest news and updates when available.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. First announced in November of 2020, Leonardo has undergone active development of itâs incredible McDonnell Douglas MD-80 for the new simulator. Itâs been a couple months since weâve last heard from the team, but recently, Stefan subtly commented on the Maddog X forum that the aircraft is currently in itâs beta stage, and the software is progressing well.Â  Leonardoâs MD-80 was originally developed for Prepar3Dv4 and FSX. Itâs widely considered by the flight simulation community to be one of the best airliners available for any simulator platform, and arguably the best MD-80 available, period. The aircraft delivers fully simulated failures, accurate systems, superb modeling, and a proactive development team.Â  Reverting back to the MSFS compatible MD-80, the team has shared a few videos on its YouTube channel, showcasing the aircraft in action. Other than their videos and promising comments regarding the aircraftâs development progress, though, we havenât received any additional information surrounding its release.Â  Stefano mentioned that more details will follow this announcement, make sure to keep up to date with Leonardoâs progress on their forums, as well as with us here at Threshold.Â </summary>

    <title>BlueBird Simulations Announces 757 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/blue75" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Up-and-coming aircraft developer BlueBird Simulations has announced their first project for flight simulation, the Boeing 757. The team contains four dedicated members, including a programmer with a plethora of experience, two model designers, and an airline pilot. Just Flight will be supporting the 757 development efforts. BlueBird informed the community that âthis will be a mid-level complexity aircraft which will be several layers more complex than default airliners.â â BlueBird Simulations intends for the 757 to be an MSFS-native aircraft to fully utilize the SDK. As of now, the aircraft is still in the early stages of systems development, but more information will be disclosed later, when the team has more progress to share. Itâs important to contextualize the recurrent theme of âassuming release datesâ by pointing out that development times may change over the course of time if the developer feels its necessary, but BlueBird is confident that the 757 will find itself on the market in the first half of 2023.Â  Head over to the BlueBird Simulations website to visit the original update post, additionally check Just Flight's Facebook post for more images of the 757âs current exterior, and to keep current with the âflying pencilsâ progress.Â </summary>
