    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently announced their gradual V2 rollout, with stage one bringing a new fly-by-wire, an improved flight model, new display rendering technology, and code optimizations that would increase the add-onâs performance. It made people wonder: how much does it improve it? TheirÂ latest blog postÂ is all about that. â They have been working hard at making the software run more efficiently, investing over a thousand hours of manhours into rebuilding their display render pipeline, auditing the 3D model and overall code to make it perform great, and balancing VRAM usage.Â  â  Then, they showcase a series of benchmarks, showing the before and after of the framerate, system specs, and resolution while comparing them with V1 and other popular aircraft add-ons. â â  Fenix finishes with a sneak peek at the Navigraph moving map integration and the new 180-pax layout accompanying V2âs first rollout. â  The aircraft is available for roughly $63.73 onÂ Fenix SimulationsâÂ official website.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Northern Sky Studio has recently released their rendition of Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport (PASI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Sitka in Alaska with a yearly average of 38,000 passengers. â The airport was built in 1942 as a military airfield during World War 2, then turned over to the city of Sitka right after it was over and converted into a civilian airport. Scheduled airline service only started a decade later with Pacific Northern Airlines. â The jet age only arrived at Sitka in March 1967, when an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-90C Golden Nugget touched its then gravel runway with 70 passengers. Gravel runway operations were still brand new to jet operators, and the 727 required a specific FAA certification before such a feat.Â  â Historical records say the âwholeâ city came to the airport to watch the landing, including the mayor, governor, and even a high school marching band. One of the employees shot an 8mm film of the landing that the local historical society preserved afterward. â The airport currently has a single terminal with a single jetway, operated mainly by Alaska Airlines, which serves the airport all year long with routes to Juneau and Ketchikan. Delta Connection runs a seasonal leg to Seattle-Tacoma. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed replica of its buildings and vehicles, full PBR materials, texture baking effects on all buildings, high-resolution textures, and custom orthophoto for the airport and surroundings. â â â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.00, requiring at least 1.47 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MLD Scenery has recently released their rendition of TimiÈoara Traian Vuia International Airport (LRTR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in Romania with a yearly average of 1.1 million passengers.  The airport was built in 1942 on a 91-hectare plot of land, originally sporting a 1,200x600m runway, a 9x5m plank cabin with offices, and a 20x8m shed.Â   A decade later, the airport received several upgrades to fit the needs of the Romanian Army, including a runway extension, bringing its length from 1,200 to 2,000 meters.Â   In the 60s, with Timisoaraâs growth becoming more and more evident and transforming the city into an economic center, the government decided to build a proper civil airport on its location, with a big passenger terminal and a 2,500m runway.  It was then modernized in the mid-1970s to meet the new demand for passenger traffic while also getting yet another runway extension. Arad International Airport took all of the Timisoara traffic during the works from 1977 to late 1979 as it only had one runway.  A new terminal for international arrivals was built between 2019 and 2021, further increasing the airportâs passenger handling capabilities.  AirConnect, Corendon Airlines, Eurowings, HiSky, Lufthansa, Sky Express, TAROM, and WizzAir serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, custom ground polygons, an up-to-date layout, custom night lighting, and a custom GSX profile. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $15.32, requiring at least 1.21 GB of free hard disk space to install.

The airport's construction started in 1963, with the official inauguration only happening six years later in 1969 by President AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s. Its primary purpose was serving inter-island connections and Europe, with regular flights to Lisbon beginning a year later. A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1995 when the airport also got its current name after the Pope's visit to the Azores four years prior. â The following decade post-new terminal brought massive growth in passenger traffic, which has been steadily growing, connecting the Azores to the world.  It's also the most important cargo airport in the Azores, handling over 10,000 tonnes yearly. Azores Airlines, Binter Canarias, British Airways, Edelweiss Air, Iberia, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SATA Air AÃ§ores, Smartwings, Swiss, TAP, Transavia, TUI fly Belgium, TUI fly Netherlands, and United Airlines all serve it, with most of them only offering their services during summer. iniBuilds' rendition is said to bring exceptional detail and immersion, with full interiors, points of interest, and more.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Yesterday morning, Mathijs Kok reappeared on the Aerosoft Forums under a new account - weeks after announcing his departure from the company after 20 years of service -defending his former company with a statement on how he shaped the forum as he'd enjoy it if he were a customer, and then signing the post as "Mathijs Kok - PMDG Simulations." â As PMDG had not officially announced such a move, the community wondered whether it was an elaborate prank rather than the next big transfer of the flight simulation niche. For a while, there were no answers from either Aerosoft or PMDG, but Robert Randazzo broke the silence, confirming that Mathijs had, in fact, joined PMDG: "I'm personally thrilled to welcome my very long-time friend, Mathijs, to the PMDG team. I'll have more to say on this topic a bit later - and I may or may not shine a light on some of what we'll have him doing as part of our expansion going forward". "Anticipate him hanging back a bit while he gains his footing and gets up-to-speed. Our culture is very different from the one he has left behind after two decades- and his role here will be quite a bit different as well. There are a few key moments in PMDG's history- and it has been 15 years since we made specific, positive changes to improve the wider skill level and capabilities of our team. Mathijs coming aboard the PMDG team is one of numerous changes taking place in the background that go a long way toward my strategic objectives for PMDG- and I assure you you will be excited when you see what that plan looks like.", he concluded. â â Mathijs himself had also made an appearance on PMDG's forum, thanking everyone for the support and explaining his decision to leave Aerosoft after so many years: "As a project manager, you have a task and resources, and they were not well aligned in my opinion. Aerosoft in 2023 is also a very different company than it was when I joined". "When he (Robert Randazzo) offered me to join his team, I did not hesitate. I did not even think about it. It feels like an adventure. One that is very welcome and really reinvigorated my love for the hobby and its users", he added. â â Then, he stated how PMDG's structure suits his style better, with no sales department or marketing office aiming exclusively at production and sales happening almost automatically in response to a great product. â Threshold will keep you informed on the matter may Robert Randazzo reveal his new position at PMDG.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly X Simulations has recently released their rendition of Teesside International Airport (EGNV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving North East England with a yearly average of 200,000 passengers.  It started as an RAF airfield in 1941, housing the RAF and the Royal Canadian Air Force during WW2.Â   Twenty years later, the airfield was developed into a civil airport named Tees-Side Airport. Many airlines served it during its first decade, including British Midland, BKS Air Transport, Dan-Air, Autair, and Channel Airways.Â   The 1970s were particularly rough for Teesside regarding scheduled services, with holiday flights becoming its primary source of passenger traffic through the wings of Northeast Airlines, Britannia Airways, Aviaco, Spantax, and Aviogenex. Â  Privatization came in 1987, with local authorities retaining their shares and the airport getting its current name: Teesside International Airport.  The airport was heavily upgraded in 2017 after a troublesome decade post-2008 crisis leading to a massive drop in passenger traffic figures leading to many airlines abandoning it for other nearby airports.Â   The renewal and subsequent takeover in 2018 brought back a lot of traffic, and the figures have been rising ever since.  BH Air, Eastern Airways, KLM, Loganair, Ryanair, and TUI Airways currently serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR texturing, custom orthophoto for the airport and surroundings, custom terminal interior, custom ground textures, high-resolution textures, and more.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $15.25, requiring at least 2.76 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
