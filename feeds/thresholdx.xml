    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, scenery developer Burning Blue Design released their rendition of Solent Airport (EGHF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The scenery, with its up-to-date airport layout and realistic 3D models, will deliver the most immersive experience for pilots when they are looking for a weekend get-away to coastal England. According to Burning Blue Design, the team has visited the airport multiple times in order to create the most realistic product possible for the community. The scenery will be based on the latest layout of the airport and will include custom light lighting, more than 200 custom-made models ranging from hangers to control towers, and high quality PBR textures. Additionally, certain hanger doors are designed to close automatically at night and must be opened by pilots using their taxi lights. Finally, the developers have optimized the airport to have it âblend in with local Photogrammetryâ and added static aircraft as well as local landmarks. For the full list of features, check out the Orbx storepage. 	Solent Airport was built as Royal Air Force base HMS Daedalus and served as a vital role in both world wars. Post war, the airport served as a testing facility for hovercrafts before being closed in 1996. It was opened in 2015 as a civilian airfield with the name Solent Airport. Currently, Solent Airport can be purchased on Orbx or the developerâs own webstore for US$20.77, excluding any sales tax that may incur. The developer recommends potential buyers to have at least 1.31GB of free space on their hard drives in order to successfully install the product.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently released their rendition of Beauvais-TillÃ© Airport (LFOB) for X-Plane 11 and 12, the tenth busiest airport in France as of 2016, with a yearly average of 4 million passengers (pre-pandemic). Itâs a popular destination for low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and WizzAir, which use it as a Parisian base.  Located only 85 km from Paris, itâs often called âParis-Beauvais Airportâ due to its proximity with the famous French city. With cheaper landing fees, less traffic and the convenience of not being in the middle of the fuss, itâs the airport of choice for many charters and LCCs. As a matter of fact, the airport has grown quite significantly after Ryanair embraced Beauvais in 1997, with the creation of a second terminal in 2010 to handle the extra traffic figures.Â   Other than WZZ and RYR with their extensive route networks to and from LFOB, the airport is also visited by Air Moldova with a single flight to Chisinau, HiSky with legs to Baia Mare and Chisinau, and EasyJet to Lisbon (flights to Milan and Nice to begin in mid-2023).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it stands, with real-world airport layout, up-to-date high-definition orthoimagery, 4K photorealisitc textures, PBR textures on ground and buildings, dynamic night lighting based of real-life color tones, 3D vegetation, 3D grass, nearby houses and farms, rain and seasonal effects on ground (XP12 only), custom high-definition PBR vehicles, and fully accurate ground markings with realistic wear and tear.  Itâs available onÂ Boundless DirectÂ for roughly $17.05, requiring at least 880 MB of free disk space to install. Shout out to flightyler on Discord for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Xometry Design has recently updated their rendition of Eagle County Regional Airport (KEGE), adding compatibility with X-Plane 12 and extra features. EGE becomes the second busiest airport in Colorado during the ski season, because of its proximity to popular skiing resorts, and the airport offers better landing conditions overall compared to Aspen (lower minimums).  Due to its seasonality, the scheduled passenger services come and go throughout the year, but it does not let down in terms of private flights, Â featuring one of the best fixed-base private operators in the United States, the Vail Valley Jet Center, with eight heated hangars, over 30 acres of overnight storage, and planeside vehicle staging.  The new scenery update adds the aforementioned compatibility with X-Plane 12, a terminal interior, custom object rework, custom jetways, and a customized mesh with an Ortho4Xp patch, now making use of X-Plane 12âs 3D trees and bushes. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $13.57 (on sale), requiring at least 2.09 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cowan Simulation has recently released their rendition of the Bell 206B3 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a popular variant of the 206 family whose production ended in 2010 (later variants were to cease production in 2017). It is their first helicopter for MSFS, after releasing eight different models for X-Plane.  The Bell 206 had its first flight in 1962, after winning a competition held by the United States Navy to develop a Light Observation Helicopter. Their D-250 design went on to become the YHO-4, where it failed to win the contract bid, and Bell found themselves trying to market it as a civil aircraft (Model 206). The first attempt didnât work well (terrible commercial success), but an eventual redesign aiming for a sleeker and aesthetic body made it a huge success. That one was launched as the Bell 206A JetRanger.Â   The first 206B JetRanger was introduced in 1971, with the 206B-3 coming in 1977 with a modified tail rotor, and improved engine. It got popular among TV channels for traffic and news reporting, armies, police departments, and private use.Â   The add-on features 4K PBR textures, realistic start up procedure, realistic flight dynamics, custom 3D instruments, virtual reality compatible, Wwise fully dynamic sound pack, detailed night lighting, and free future updates.Â   Itâs available for purchase onÂ CowanSimâs websiteÂ for $32.99, requiring at least 2 GB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Low-End PC Studios has recently released their updated rendition of Inca Manco CÃ¡pac International Airport (SPJL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, one of the highest airports in the World at 12,552 feet. It serves Juliaca, the Capital of San Roman Province in Southeastern Peru, the largest city in the region with 276,110 inhabitants. If being one of the highest commercial airports in South America was not enough, it also features one of the longest runways, with 4,200 meters of length.Â   It was named after Manco CÃ¡pac, the founder of the Inca Civilization in Cuzco.Â   Itâs currently served by JetSmart PerÃº, LATAM PerÃº, and Sky Airline Peru, with scheduled flights to Lima and Cuzco (LATAM PerÃº only). Despite being an International airport, it doesnât feature a single scheduled international flight.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a 3D terminal and tower, PBR textures, and projected mesh for custom runway. The v2 update focused on correcting the windsock, adding two new city landmarks, a runway elevation profile, and runway texture improvements.Â   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $6.58 (38% off), requiring at least 167 MB of free disk space.

    <title>PMDG Updates 737 Lineup for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-12-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmd737" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/63a6d4c34c758f9f4b666bd5_boeing1.png" rel="enclosure" type="image/png" length="2415099"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently launched an update (3.00.0053) to their 737 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator, focusing on increasing the quality and performance of the product. The highlights of the update include further work on the aircraftâs stability and prevention of eventual disturbances caused by the simulatorâs exaggerated gusts, the addition of computationally derived stall angle of attack models for all wing configuration conditions on all of the three airplanes, reworked cabin collision models to allow native transition from cockpit to cabin, soundscape improvements (and expansion) in the cabin area, marked as a work in progress. The remainder of the changelog follows down below:  â Regarding the 737-900, Robert RandazzoâsÂ update announcement postÂ mentions good progress on the testing, with a few areas they intend to clean up before the release.Â   The Universal Flight Tablet is partially working but not quite ready yet due to the fact they plan to build an universal framework that allows the EFB to work across their entire aircraft lineup, including stuff that is yet to come like the 777, the 737 MAX, and the 747. Such universality takes development time, but itâs said to be coming soon.Â   The DC-6 update is waiting on an Asobo update for MSFS that has to do with the avionics, and when that is out, PMDG will be able to roll out theirs with a greater range of GPS options, improved trim and flight characteristics, and extra stability for the autopilot when tracking a course or an approach.Â   They claim to have âquite a bitâ going on behind the scenes, which will be revealed once the 737-900 and the EFB are out to the public. Â The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Images are courtesy of AllNaturalBlue.
