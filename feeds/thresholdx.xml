    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Known developer for X-Plane 11, ShortFinal Design (aka MisterX6) has released his long-awaited KSFO Definitive Project for X-Plane 11. With many updates from the previous rendition, this visual rendition of San Francisco International impresses one and all, with new techniques used by the developer. MisterX6 released his first and only freeware rendition of KSFO back in 2015, and it underwent updates till he moved to payware projects. Since then, the San Francisco area received no love from developers, till SFD announced he was revisiting the area and had started from scratch on the project. This rendition has a vast inclusion list that has been provided. Starting off, the usage of SAM for jetways and airport operations has been used to add realism and life to the airport. The airport layout shipped is the current layout of KSFO as of 2022. Various animations of airport vehicles, workers, and passengers have also been included. The usage of PBR textures is present throughout the scenery package. For the complete feature list, you can view it on the X-Plane.Org Store This rendition of KSFO is now available on the .Org Store and sells for $26.95. If you are interested in other packages developed by ShortFinal Design, you can view his payware catalog on the .Org Store as well.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. IniBuilds has announced its partnership with iBlueYonderpour to develop its upcoming Dallas Love Field (KDAL) scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator. After complimenting the CEO of iBlueYonder, Bill Womack, IniBuilds revealed that it has already started development on KDAL. However, neither developers have disclosed any details on either the scenery or the partnership. Though IniBuilds is well known within the community, iBlueYonder may be a less familiar face to some. In reality however, iBlueYonder is very experienced in the creation of sceneries for P3D, X-Plane, FSX, and MSFS. More details on the developers can be found here. But why choose KDAL? Though Lovefield is often overshadowed by Fort Worth, it is located much closer to Dallas city center and serves as a main hub for Southwest Airlines, a well-known low cost airline that operates an all 737 fleet. Southwest, Delta and Alaska also flies a few flights to select destinations per day. â The IniBuilds forum post ends with the announcement of a trailer about this airport that will be available soon.

After the great success of the B-146 Professional for x-plane 11, the developers of Just Flight have set themselves a new challenge: As in real life, they want to develop the 146 Professional into the RJ Professional, a new range that will be exclusively available for MSFS. Just Flight are excited to announce that they are working on the RJ professional range which will include 3 variants: The RJ70, the RJ85 and the RJ100. Variants exclusively available for MSFS. â If we look at the historical context of aviation, the RJ range, derived from the 146 range from 1993 onwards (1988 for the RJ100). We can note improvements made from this date, such as the introduction of an EFIS cockpit with digital displays replacing the ADI, HSI and engine instrumentation present on the 146. â This is exactly what Just Flight is putting forward in the development of the RJ Professional, the same changes are being implemented. There have been many other changes between the 146 and the RJ, both in real life and in the simulation world with Just Flight indicating these changes on the aircraft web page. â â â On the 15th of August, Just Flight published development updates with images available of this future product, both cockpit and exterior model images are seen, without telling us much more. They simply inform us that work is still in progress, that pictures are available and that they will keep us informed of future updates.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After having developed the A310 for MSFS, iniBuilds announces the continuation of its partnership with MSFS with two new aircraft under development: The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny and the Grumman G-21A Goose. Both aircraft will be 100% free and developed exclusively for MSFS. In a forum post, the CEO of iniBuilds is pleased to announce the continuation of their partnership with MSFS with these two historic aircraft under development. The Curtiss JN-4 Jenny, was a military training aircraft with production starting in 1915. After the end of the First World War, there was a surplus of aircraft that became civilian aircraft in 1918. From then on, the JN-4 became a very popular trainer for solo training flights, for the civilian market. It is therefore a historic aircraft full of adventure and history that iniBuilds is developing for a modern simulator, more than 100 years after the real-life Curtiss JN-4 Jenny was released. The second aircraft under development, the Grumman G-21A Goose, has a different story. Originally, it was a group of Long Islanders who wanted a business aircraft to fly to and from New York. So they approached Grumman. Following discussions, Grumman converted the Grumman Goose and that's how the G-21A was born, in around 1936. The G-21A was later upgraded to carry 8 passengers and fly military missions all over the world. iniBuilds has endeavoured to reproduce this atmosphere in the aircraft cabin with a bar, champagne bucket and restroom facilities to remain true to the model.Â  The first pictures of the cockpit show the progress the developers have made on this aircraft, which already makes us want to fly it!</summary>
