    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Shadescene has recently released their rendition of Sultan Abdul Halim Airport (WMKA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Alor Setar in Malaysia with a yearly average of 817,253 passengers.  It was established as an airfield in the early 1930s known as Lapangan Terbang Kepala Batas, becoming a military airbase soon after WW2 for the Japanese during their occupation of Malaysia.Â   The post-war period saw the ownership change to the Royal Air Force, which controlled the airfield until Malaysia gained independence in 1957.  Two years later, the airport was heavily upgraded to accommodate commercial operations, being re-inaugurated in 1965 as Alor Setar Airport. It was a domestic airport with flights to Kuala Lumpur and other major cities.  The current name was given during its redevelopment project in 2006, featuring a much larger passenger capacity, modern amenities, and more.  Itâs served by AirAsia, Batik Air Malaysia, Firefly, and Malaysia Airlines, with flights to Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru (AirAsia only).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom terraforming, custom scenery objects, a terminal interior, hand-placed taxiways, full day and night cycle, hand-crafted ground markings and textures, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $9.79, requiring at least 180.42 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MXI Design has recently released their rendition of KukÃ«s International Airport Zayed (LAKU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of KukÃ«s in Albania with a yearly average of 40,000 passengers.  The airport was built in 1929 as a domestic airfield offering an air connection to Tirana, which operated for 15 years until it was turned into a military airport.Â   Civil service was only reactivated in the late 90s, during the Kosovo War, when the United Arab Emirates organized a refugee camp in KukÃ«s, which also required an airfield for supplies. It didnât take long until they had the idea to develop a civil airport instead as a gift to the population. Two years later, an understanding was reached, and the construction work got the green light.  Construction started in 2003, reaching completion in 2005, generating more than 200 jobs, and opening more tourist opportunities for the region. On the other hand, the opening only happened very recently, in 2021, when the first-ever commercial flight took place.  The airport is served on a seasonal basis by Air Albania and Wizz Air, with five destinations in total.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, high-detailed ground textures, PBR materials, a terminal interior, 3D passengers, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.88, requiring at least 449.77 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, SimWorks shared a few exclusive previews of their upcoming PC-12 aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator, showcasing the planeâs detailed exterior modeling and texturing in various liveries and weather conditions. From the pictures provided by SimWorks, we can see that the PC-12âs exterior has been meticulously recreated. Everything from the propellers (4 blades and 5 blades options are available) to the landing gear and cabin door have been modeled and textured in great detail. As for the interior of the aircraft, the developer claimed that it is almost complete with the team putting on the final touches in the cockpit. In addition to the new images of the plane, the developers also shared a roadmap for the PC-12. The roadmap provides an overview of the various systems that are currently being worked on for the aircraft. We can see that SimWorks has already completed the engine stimulation and is around 50% done with the avionics system. Currently, SimWorks has not revealed the release date and pricing of the much anticipated PC-12. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <title>Double T Releases Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Double T has recently released their rendition of Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (KPHF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Virginia Peninsula in the United States with a yearly average of 430,000 passengers.  The airport was built on a patch of land that belonged to Camp Patrick Henry, with commercial service starting in 1949 with Piedmont and Capital Airlines.  In 1951, a fire caused significant damage to the passenger terminal, leading to a complete rebuilding that was finished in 1955. It also included upgrading the traffic control tower and a runway extension.  In 1975, the airport was granted international status, back when it was still called Patrick Henry Airport (after the aforementioned military camp). It was served by four airlines: Allegheny, National, Piedmont, and United.  The airline deregulation of 1978 led to a massive drop in passenger numbers and airline service, with four major operators abandoning the airport one after the other.  A few years later, in 1984, they hired a new executive director to try and fix the unimpressive traffic figures. He planned to construct a business park within the airport to attract air carriers.Â   The plan was a huge success, with Newport becoming Americaâs fastest-growing airport two years in a row.  In the early 2000s, the airport was expanded to meet the demand, with new parking lots, a new passenger concourse, and, consequently, more airlines embraced Newport.  The last decade was rough with PHF, with AirTran stopping its operations after the Southwest merger and Delta suspending their service to Atlanta in 2020. Avelo brought hope in 2022, but the operations were suspended within months.  The airport is currently served by American Eagle (Charlotte) and Netjets (Birmingham, Columbus, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Raleigh-Durham, and Teterboro).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made PBR ground textures, hand-made terminals,Â cargo buildings, custom night lighting, sloped runways, custom jetways, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.97, requiring at least 660.03 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!   â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Barelli MSFS Addon has recently released their rendition of MÃ¡laga Airport (LEMG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in Spain after Madrid, Barcelona, and Palma de Mallorca, averaging 18.4 million passengers per year.  Itâs one of the oldest Spanish airports, opened in 1919, with scheduled air service starting that same year with Didier Daurat flying passengers to Barcelona, Toulouse, Alicante, Tangier, and Casablanca.  The runway had its first extension work in 1960, followed by the construction of a new passenger terminal at the very center of the site.  In 1991, a new passenger terminal (now Terminal 2) was opened, designed by Ricardo Boffil. The old terminal was transformed into a general aviation terminal four years later.  Terminal 3 was opened by King Juan Carlos in March 2010, starting operations the day after.  Only two of the three terminals are currently operating (Terminals 2 and 3). Terminal 2 is low-cost oriented, and hosts EasyJet, EasyJet Switzerland, and Ryanair, and Terminal 3 is used by the other airlines.  Being one of the busiest airports in Spain, the list of operators is substantial: itâs a focus city for EasyJet, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, and Vueling, and most European carriers regularly visit it. London Gatwick is the busiest destination, with an average of 885,608 passengers, and Barcelona is a close second with 778,527.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, landside buildings, custom ground clutter, custom night lighting, and an up-to-date ground layout.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. V Pilot Designs has recently released their rendition of Yampa Valley Airport (KHDN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Steamboat Springs, Hayden, and Craig, with a yearly average of 160,000 passengers. The airport was built on a 435-acre parcel of land in Hayden, Colorado, acquired by the Rott County Board of Commissioners in 1946. It opened to the public in 1950, with a single grass runway and basic facilities. It was then called Rott County Airport. The runway was paved 14 years later, in 1964, allowing more aircraft to fly into the airport. Then, in 1996, the airport underwent a major transformation by constructing a new, state-of-the-art terminal that made Yampa Valley more efficient and passenger-friendly. Itâs currently a gateway to the Yampa Valley Region and its world-renowned ski resorts, natural beauty, and parks. It recently underwent a two-stage expansion project, with an apron expansion adding a new parking position in 2018 and a terminal expansion in 2020 with a seventh gate to match the seven parking positions.  As a curiosity, the airport has no control tower, and pilots must coordinate their actions via CTAF or UNICOM. Itâs served on a seasonal basis by Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings, custom textures, custom night lighting, and more. Itâs available on the MSFS Marketplace for $14.99.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. The team at AviaStorm has chosen to simulate the IDS (Interdiction/Strike) version of the Tornado as seen in service with the German Air Force (GAF). This variant was in service up until the early 2000s and comes armed with a substantial range of unguided weapons including the MK-80 series and European weapons such as the Matra 250ED. In addition, AviaStorm is also introducing several new weapons to DCS, including the Komoran anti-ship missile and MW1 cluster munition dispenser. In a nod to the varied roles the Tornado played in real-life, the team is incorporating a reconnaissance pod into the model. This inclusion promises to add another layer to DCS mission planning, especially for virtual squadrons. Despite their focus on the IDS variant, AviaStorm is also committed to including liveries of every user nation at the module's initial release, namely GAF, RAF, IAF, and RSAF. However, they've hinted that RAF exclusive weapons are not planned for the initial release. As for future versions of the Tornado, AviaStorm has kept plans close to their chest, only hinting that anything is possible. One thing is certain: an AI backseater akin to Jester is in the pipeline. As the role of the backseater is more challenging than that of the pilot, the team is deliberating the most efficient way to implement this feature. On the topic of radar technology, AviaStorm is also exploring available options. They will either adopt suitable existing technologies or, if necessary, build a new radar system from scratch. In their pursuit of accuracy, AviaStorm is using multiple reference aircraft for their simulation. The primary aircraft being scanned is the 44+56 Tornado, now adorned in a commemorative scheme "Bunte Kuh" (Colorful Cow) to honor the Tornado's service with JaboG-34. This plane is currently on display at the Traditionsgemeinschaft JaboG 34 AllgÃ¤u. In addition, the team is also using the IDS/RECCE Tornado 44+97, which is on display at the Flugwerft SchleiÃheim near Munich, Germany. This aircraft went into service in 1985 and retired after reaching the 4000 flight hour limit in 2008, with its last two years spent as part of the ISAF troops supporting operations in Afghanistan. The Following chart displays the weapon chart which depicts what AviaStorm are planning to bring to this magnificent jet. This is all subject to change however this is already an extensive list and is sure to keep users satisfied with plenty of options. AviaStorm refrains from setting a specific timeline for the release of the Tornado IDS. Their commitment is to quality over speed, striving to create the highest level of Tornado simulation possible. While this approach may mean a longer wait for fans, the team is confident that the eventual release will provide an unmatched virtual flight experience, worth every second of the wait. â Threshold now covers all DCS World related news. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Squawk Ident has recently released their rendition of Hang Nadim International Airport (WIDD), serving the city of Batam, Indonesia, with a yearly average of 6.5 million passengers.  Officially opened in 1965 as Batam Island International Airport, it was later renamed Hang Nadim International Airport after Laksamana Hang Nadim Pahlawan Kechik, a legendary warrior from the Batam region.Â   The airport was very important to the industrial growth of Batam, which was designated as a free trade zone in 1971. Its proximity to Singapore made it a gateway for foreign investments and trading.  A new passenger terminal was built in 2002, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and focusing heavily on attracting more international flights and promoting regional tourism.  Five years later, the airport underwent a major upgrade program, with the construction of a new runway, taxiways, aprons, and the extension of the passenger terminal. The new infrastructure attracted airlines from various countries, becoming a low-cost alternative to Singapore Changi.  It has the longest runway in Indonesia at 4,028 meters, making it the perfect diversion airport for Singapore Changi, easily accommodating Boeing 777s, 747s, Airbus A380s, etc.  Batik Air, Batik Air Malaysia, Citilink, Garuda Indonesia, Jeju Air, Lion Air, Nam Air, Saudia, Super Air Jet, Susi Air, and Wings Air serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, cargo hangars, a basic terminal interior, an up-to-date ground layout, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $11.21, requiring at least 165.27 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published theÂ second development updateÂ of this month, with information on future 737 updates, console liveries, new marketplace arrivals, UFT, 777, and more.  Randazzo begins with information on the 737 Lineup updates for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which have been sent to the beta team, including changes to prepare the aircraft for the Universal Flight Tablet.Â   The Xbox liveries for the 737 are going through marketplace intake and should be made available soon. They are still exploring manners to minimize user costs for liveries.  They have also begun pushing the 737-600 and 737-900 to the Marketplace along with their liveries, with their prediction pointing to an end of July release.  The Universal Flight Tablet is being moved into its final leg of testing. It has been tested on a single airframe so far (the 737-700) to minimize developmental hassles. No previews are available yet.  The 777 has progressed significantly since FSExpo, with PMDG looking into previewing it soon.Â   They finish with a quick note on the DC-6, which should be getting an update in August.  Their product lineup for MSFS is available on theirÂ websiteÂ and in the Marketplace, although only partially. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
