    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. DarkBlueScenery has recently released their rendition of Kansai International Airport (RJBB) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving the Greater Osaka Area with a yearly average of 28 million passengers, making it the 3rd busiest in Japan. â It opened in 1994 and was built to relieve overcrowding at Itami Airport, Osakaâs former main airport, with two large terminals designed by Renzo Piano. Itâs the longest terminal in the world, with a length of 1.7km. â Construction work started in 1987, and they had to build an artificial island with a sea wall, drainage system, and bridge to connect with the city. It eventually became the most expensive civil project in modern history, with a 15 billion dollar investment. The âgrowing painsâ of creating an earthquake-proof artificial island paved the way for the New Kitakyushu Airport, Kobe Airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, and even Hong Kong International Airport.Â  â â Its earthquake-proofness was tested just a year after its inauguration when Japan was struck by the Great Hanshin earthquake, whose epicenter was only 20 km from the airport. Yet, it didnât sustain any damage at all. Four years later, its design was proven again when it survived a typhoon.Â  â â The fact it sits on an artificial piece of land has its downsides, though, with the total costs rising to 20 billion in the mid-2000s with all the maintenance work to stop it from sinking, which the engineers had predicted and expected. â â A new terminal building was inaugurated in 2012, further increasing its passenger handling capabilities. â Itâs a hub for All Nippon Airways, FedEx Express, Japan Airlines, Jetstar Japan, Nippon Cargo Airlines, and Peach Aviation. Itâs served by many airlines from the neighboring countries and a few popular carriers from Europe, such as Air France, KLM, and Lufthansa. â â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K textures, custom ground markings, custom taxiway signs, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, accurate terraforming, and an accurately represented runway 06R/24L at its current status. â â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.41, requiring at least 808.75 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Aerosoftâs Airbus A330 Shifted to MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has published their first A330 development update for 2024, stating their decision to shift the development effort to the upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, allowing them to âgreatly expand the focus of the project.â â Announced three years ago, in January 2021, their A330 project wonât be coming to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, as they have decided to focus on the upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 instead. Aerosoft will include multiple engine options, including a simultaneous release of the Neo and Ceo variants.  Mathijs Kok, Aerosoftâs former project manager, has made a statement in the Aerosoft forums, saying itâs a âpuzzling statementâ and a âsurprising twist,â given they had recently tuned and tweaked the engine simulation and the new simulator might render all that work useless, leading to a full rework, and, potentially, further delays. âAs there is no known release date of FS2024 and nobody knows how much adaptation will be needed, you end up with a project with no scheduled release dateâ, he completed.  â Their decision to release for MSFS 2024 leads to many questions because little is known about the simâs innards, how the backward compatibility will work, and how much it could further complicate the development process.  Thereâs no release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Developer Flying Fries who you may know for the freeware âScrapyard Monsterâ that was released in early 2023 has plans to release a payware version of the Hughes XF-11 Mk I. With development already charging ahead the project has an anticipated release date within Q1 of 2024. The Hughes XF-11 was an aerial reconnaissance aircraft designed for the US Army Air Force. It is based on a highly modified version of a plane designed by Hughes as a private venture. Taking inspiration from the P-38 Lightening the XF-11 features 2 huge Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp engines paired with 8 bladed contrarotating propellers by Hamilton. The XF-11 had a reported top speed of 390 knots at 33000 feet and a maximum altitude of 42000 feet. The XF-11 will feature a highly detailed interior and exterior model with 4k textures, an era-correct autopilot as well as the option to use a Garmin GNS 530 or GTN 750. Pilots looking for a more challenging experience will have the option to enable random failures with configurable severity. Flying Fries has stated that the hope is to have the aircraft released in February but there hasnât been any information about a price for the plane. You can check out Flying Friesâ other works on their website here. Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for all the flight sim news that matters to you!Â  â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Realworld Scenery has recently released their rendition of Dayton International Airport (KDAY) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Dayton, Ohio, with a yearly average of 580,000 passengers. â â It opened in 1936 as Dayton Municipal Airport, with three 1,100-meter concrete runways and connecting taxiways. Further development was only to happen in 1959 when a new $5.5 million terminal designed by Yount, Sullivan, and Lecklider went under construction.Â  â The terminal was renovated for the first time in 1989, designed by Levin Porter Associates and costing around the ballpark of $50 million. Further renovation happened a decade later, coming at $25 million and reaching completion in 2002. â â American Air, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, and United Express serve it. Atlanta, Chicago Oâhare, and Charlotte are the busiest destinations, with 122,960 passengers, 103,320, and 72,390, respectively. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, custom night lighting, a custom-designed starting hangar for general aviation, high-resolution ground textures, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.03, requiring at least 1.92 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>BlueBird 757 January update </title>
    <updated>2024-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/bb757j"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/65b2ee8317a65ef1bfbb8781_4.PNG"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BlueBird Simulations have released another comprehensive video about the development progress of their 757 which is in development for Microsoft Flight Sim. The video features many members of the development team giving a run down on what they have been working on along with the project manager Shervin giving a detailed update on progress, what has been done and what is to come.Â  â An update on 2024 and what is to come The update video begins by explaining that last year lead programmer Eric retired from flight sim dev work, shortly after Shervin brought 3 new programmers on board who have spent the last 5 months rebuilding the 757 to make it a full study-level aircraft, departing from the original plan of making it a mid-level aircraft. Shervin has informed us that they are optimistic for 2024 and have gone into some detail about what this means, although no promises can be made for a 2024 release the team is positive about the progress being made and overall excited for what the coming year holds.Â  â The all-important sounds The second big announcement of this in-depth update is the welcome news that Boris from Boris Audioworks has joined BlueBird to develop the sounds for the 757! As those of you who have used Borisâ sound packs for MSFS over the years will know, this is a very welcome announcement! The sound of the 757 is gorgeous and thanks to Boris we will be able to enjoy those beautiful 757 and RB211/ Pratt and whitney sounds in stunning detail.Â  â Jacks update The video continues with a brief segment featuring one of the lead programmers, Jack. He gives us a rundown of the work that has been going on behind the scenes with the FMC, IRS and Weather radar system.Â  â â Daveâs Update In the next part of this nearly 30-minute update video, we hear from another programmer, Dave. Dave gives a run down of what he has been working on over the last few months. Dave gives us a detailed run-through of the IRS system and the CDU. He also gives us some teasers of the beautiful 3D works he has been masterfully working on.Â  â â Hoomanâs update Hooman joined the BlueBird team a few months ago as an Aircraft system software developer. In his detailed portion of the video, he gives us a rundown of the work behind the scenes in developing the various systems of the 757 and their logic. Using system schematics Hooman has painstakingly gone through the process of making the systems as realistic as possible and in this section he shows us briefly how he does it! We get a rundown of the electrical system and how he converts schematics into code using what can only be assumed is some sort of wizardry.Â  â Romain's update:Â  Real-world airline pilot Romain has been hard at work over the last few months helping to develop and tune the Pratt and Whitney engines along with finalising the final versions of the RB211s. The current engine work is set on refining fuel flow and drag parameters. Romain also is actively working on the flight model, as he has been over the last 2 years.Â  â Conclusion Toward the end of this video update, we are shown an abbreviated scope of work for the upcoming 757. It is also confirmed in this section that BlueBird is partnering with Navigraph to bring a realistic and highly functional EFB to the aircraft. We are also shown a brief preview of the BlueBird 767 virtual cockpit! The 767 is being developed separately from the 757 but one thing is certain, it will share its level of detail!Â  â You can watch the full video update here:Â </summary>

    <title>Honeycomb Swindled by Partner and Selling Itself to Another Company</title>
    <updated>2024-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/hcbrev"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/65b44ed1636980b359de61f9_FqPdY6maIAAbGSf.jpeg"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. In an announcement made both on their support Discord server and Facebook Page, Honeycomb Aeronautical CEO Nicki Repenning provides a lengthy update on the state of the company, and alleges how he, and by extension, the entire customer base who had pre-ordered products were taken advantage of by Honeycombâs parent company, and now ex-business partner, whom is yet to be named. â He starts out by apologizing for the extended delay in communication, saying that âIâm not trying to make any excuses or deny my responsibility for what happened,â and that he should have âacted sooner,â and he â[has] no one but myself to blame for that.â â Continuing, he starts off with the story on how Honeycomb was founded as a business idea in 2012, and he was going to use his experience with Saitek, and take advantage of the gap between low-end and very-high-end products, and provide high-quality products at a decent price point. In 2016, he found a partner to start Honeycomb with, who he was good friends with, and was head of a company that was selling various video game accessories already in the United States, an accomplishment that Repenning helped with. Repenniing had agreed that his partner would run the financial side of the business, as well as use the company and connections his partner had in the manufacturing industry in Asia based in Hong Kong to manage the manufacturing. Repenning was to provide the designs and his partner was able to convert those designs into something that could be mass produced. Additionally, they agreed that his partnerâs companies would handle the distribution. â He alleges that during the time the Alpha Flight Controls were being developed, his partner kept pushing off finalizing their shareholder agreement, but when the company was finally established, Repeninng discovered that he had no shares or ownership in Honeycomb. After confronting his partner about this, his partner explained that this was a requirement for the loans. Repenning goes on to allege that to this day, no agreement has been signed.During Honeycombâs first two years of operation, Repenning was concerned mostly with product development, and did not suspect anything wrong. However, by mid-2022, Honeycomb and his partnerâs company wasnât doing so well, so he looked at the finances in more detail. Repenning alleges that, âevery invoice and purchase order, one by one, I discovered that the service fees added to the factory cost (for the services provided in Hong Kong) were significantly higher than what we had agreed,â and âthe sales prices on the invoices to my partnerâs distribution companies were lower than agreed.â He confronted his partner about this, but the partner just passed it off as âjust an accounting errorâ and it would be fixed. Most shocking of all, he alleges that the money from Charlie Pedal pre-orders did not go to the manufacturing, and had âgone elsewhere.â He then flew to Hong Kong âto meet with the factory and my now soon-to-be ex-partner to find out what was really going on.â He was able to negotiate a deal between the manufacturer, his âsoon to be ex-business partner,â and âwhere my partner and his companies would no longer handle sales and distribution and I would also handle the factory partner directly. As part of the agreement, I was committing to help the factory recover the outstanding invoices by paying a significant premium on the existing stock as well as on the Charlie production. In exchange, the factory agreed to manufacture the Charlie, despite the outstanding debt, but I had to pay for the injection tooling as well as a 50% deposit of the production cost upfront.â  â Repenning elaborates that âsince it is highly unlikely that I will receive the payments for the pre-orders from my ex-partner, I am currently working on several finance deals to be able to start production as soon as possible.â  â He continues on with giving us an update on the state of Honeycomb currently, saying that its online storefront, run through Shopify, has been closed and is no longer accepting refunds, so the only way to get money back is through a bank or credit card company. According to Repenning, this is also the state of RMAâs, due to being controlled by his business partner, which wholly owns the Honeycomb company based in Hong Kong, they have been unable to ship return labels. Repenning goes on to mention that âThe one good news is that we have reached an agreement, that he will sell his assets in Honeycomb if I can find a new partner to buy him out,â Â and he is in talks with other potential buyers that will help continue the Honeycomb product lines.  â He also writes a heartfelt thank you to his tech and support staff, despite being caught up in this situation and being without payment, âhave stayed with me.â  â To conclude his statement, he apologizes for the lack of communication, and thanks everyone for their patience. â You can read the full text of his update on Honeycombâs Facebook page here. â Threshold will be following this story as it unfolds, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <title>MisterX's Hakodate Airport Scenery Pirated</title>
    <updated>2024-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/msxpir"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/65b4ffca7269cdcd348b6756_2024-01-27%2014_05_48-RJCH_Comparison_2.jpg%20-%20IrfanView.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. In the never-sleeping world of flight simulation, the release of new airport scenery is always a moment of excitement for the avid simmer. This was the case with the recent introduction of Hakodate Airport (RJCH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, developed by AC Scenery. This addition promised an immersive experience for pilots flying to the island of Hokkaido in Japan, featuring custom ground textures, night lighting, and photorealistic details. However, this initial excitement was soon overshadowed by allegations of copyright infringement, casting a dark shadow over the integrity of this release and its developer. The controversy surfaced when MisterX (also known as ShortFinal Design), a highly esteemed developer in the flight simulation community, raised serious allegations about the newly released scenery. MisterX has been a known name in the X-Plane scenery world for many years and he is known for popular sceneries such as his renditions of San Diego International Airport (KSAN), San Francisco International Airport (KFSO) and City, Los Angeles International Airport (KLAX) and many more.  In a discussion in our Discord, MisterX stated, âThat scenery is a blatant rip-off of my X-Plane freeware.â These claims were further supported by comparisons between MisterX's original work and the AC Scenery product, revealing striking similarities in models and textures. â Because of these allegations, we immediately removed the article promoting the Hakodate Airport scenery from our editorialâpending further investigation. Sadly, this incident is not an isolated case in our world of flight simulation. Copyright infringement, unfortunately, has been a recurring issue, affecting both developers and the community. In the past, there have been several instances where assets from established developers have been used without consent, leading to legal battles and community uproar. These cases range from minor texture copying to complete model theft, impacting both freeware and commercial products. The implications of such actions are profound, discouraging developers from investing time and effort into creating new content and potentially stifling innovation in the community. The scenery has since been taken down from Simmarket, where it was available at the time when MisterX contacted Threshold.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published a new development update in their forum featuring work-in-progress flight deck previews of their upcoming Boeing 777 for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Randazzo begins with a promise: they will try to be more transparent with their development process, showing stuff behind the scenes, like their recent trip to compare their 777 with the real 777. He emphasizes they have never done it before but have been considering it since Mathijs Kok joined the team and advocated for more sharing.  The beta process is ongoing, and they have been focusing on killing conflicts between their C++ code and Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs Clang compiler, aiming for high stability. With the release window potentially getting closer, they have been working on preview images and video, which will roll out gradually. PMDG is feeling very good about the project and is looking for a suitable release timeline, which will be communicated beforehand.  â Their new preview showcases parts of the cockpit that make their 3D modeler happy, details that were impossible with the previous platforms. They think itâs the finest 777 simulation yet created outside and even inside the enterprise environment, with more to come on that later. â âWe are absolutely certain she will meet even the highest expectations for 777 lovers and 777 interested simmers alikeâ, concludes Randazzo.  â Thereâs no release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Gold Coast Airport (YBCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Gold Coast and Tweed Heads, Australia, with a yearly average of 6.4 million passengers, making it the 7th busiest airport in the country. â  It was built in 1936, consisting of three grass strips whose sole intent was to provide an emergency landing spot for aircraft flying between Brisbane and Sydney, with passenger service only beginning three years later. Regular service was only to begin after WW2, with Queensland Airlines and Butler Air Transport, followed by Ansett in 1950 and Trans Australia Airlines in 1954. â  Taxiways and runways were fully paved by 1958, allowing for the operation of larger, heavier aircraft such as the DC-9 and L-188 Electra. â  The current passenger terminal was opened in 1981 by Acting Prime Minister Douglas Anthony. The following year saw the main runway extended to 2,042 meters, allowing for the operation of wide-body jet aircraft. It was later extended to 2,500 meters sometime in 2007. â The passenger terminal was upgraded in 2010, with an expansion that doubled its total size, accommodating a decade's worth of growth in passenger volume. It was then expanded again in 2016, 2019, and 2022, with a 30,000-square-meter expansion and overall infrastructure modernization.  â It's a hub for Bonza. AirAsia X, Air New Zealand, Eastern Air Services, Jetstar, Qantas, QantasLink, Rex Airlines, Seair Pacific, and Virgin Australia serve it regularly. â  Developed by Matteo Veneziani, the scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, 4K textures, an interior on the main terminal, unique GSE vehicles, dynamic airport lighting, custom ground textures, custom animated jetways, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â  It's available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $16.20, requiring at least 4.70 GB of free hard disk space to install.

Plans for a new airport and its respective groundwork started in 1954, but a Coup DâEtat in September 1955 led to a nine-year-long pause in the construction work. It was inaugurated in 1967, 13 years after it all started. â In the 1980s, AerolÃ­neas Argentinas had connecting flights in Jujuy from Buenos Aires, destined for Bogota, Guayaquil, Panama City, and Miami. â It was remodeled in 2012 with a new control tower, an 8000 square meter passenger terminal, and a new car park holding up to 323 vehicles. â AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Andes LÃ­neas AÃ©reas, FlyBondi, and JetSmart Argentina serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a highly detailed passenger terminal and its interior, a detailed control tower, an up-to-date ground layout, custom runway materials, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.86, requiring at least 137.16 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSoares has recently announced the development and imminent release of Brasilia - President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the third busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. â The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more, divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. â New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. â Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. â The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, custom terraforming, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. â Thereâs no information on the release date, but the scenery will be made available for free when the time comes.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The Microsoft Flight Simulator team has recently released their fourteenth local legend: the Bell 47J Ranger, the first helicopter to carry a United States president. Introduced in 1956, the 47J Ranger is the executive variant of the Bell 47, which was the first helicopter certified for civilian use and one of the most popular helicopters to exist, with 5,600 built. While the Bell 47 could only seat two people, the 47J could seat four. â Two units were purchased by the American government in 1957 to transport the president, Dwight Eisenhower, to and from the White House. They were eventually removed from presidential duties in 1962 but still handled VIP transports until they were fully retired in 1967. â Three hundred sixty-one units were manufactured over its production period, handling VIP transport, cargo, air ambulance, commuter flights, aerial surveying, and military applications. It was also featured in many popular movies, such as James Bondâs Thunderball from 1965. â Powered by a 260 hp Lycoming VO-540-B1B piston engine, it can cruise at 91 mph, with a service ceiling of 11,000 ft and a range of 260 miles.  â Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs rendition features two landing gear types, with seven liveries per variant. â Itâs available in the Marketplace for $14.99.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
