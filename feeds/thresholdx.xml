    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Dubai International Airport (OMDB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fifth busiest airport in the world with a yearly average of 88 million passengers. â It was opened in 1960 after one year of construction work, with a 1,800-meter runway made of compacted sand, which was enough for most airplanes. Three years later, they began constructing an asphalt runway with 2,800 meters of total extension, followed by the construction of hangars, installation of navigational aids, and passenger terminal improvements.  To prepare for the wide bodies in the 1970s, a new terminal was built with an enclosed floor area of 13,400 square meters. Then, the existing asphalt runway was lengthened to 3,810 meters, along with some upgrades to allow the operation of Boeing 747s and Concordes. The second runway opened in April 1984.  Terminal 2 opened in 1998 as part of the 1997 development master plan. The second stage, Terminal 3, began in 2004 and reached completion four years later, with a two-year delay and a cost of 4.55 billion USD.Â   The arrival of the Airbus A380 led to a $230 million investment in adapting some of the stands for the aircraft. Concourse 3 followed soon after, increasing the passenger handling capabilities to 79 million a year.  Itâs a hub for Air India Express, Emirates, FedEx Express, flydubai, and IndiGo. The visitorsâ list includes Aegean Airlines, Aeroflot, Air Canada, Air France, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Cebu Pacific, China Eastern, China Southern, Cyprus Airways, Eurowings, Finnair, Iran Air, KLM, Korean Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Smartwings, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, and Wizz Air.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a hand-crafted ground poly, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, correct taxi signage, an up-to-date layout, custom low-poly static aircraft, LOD optimization for optimal performance, custom GSX profile, and configuration options.  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $25.30, requiring at least 4.44 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has recently published the results of their yearly Community Survey, with answers from 23,376 participants worldwide. From the most played flight simulator to the most popular graphics card among flight simmers, they got all our questions covered.  Microsoft Flight Simulator leads the 2023 popularity chart with 70.8% of the respondents using it as their primary flight simulator, followed by X-Plane in second with 13.1%, and Prepar3d in 3rd with 4.6%. The gap has widened compared to 2022, where Microsoft Flight Simulator already had a comfortable lead, but X-Plane 11 had 23% of the respondents playing it frequently, and 12 around 15%. While Navigraph has taken a slightly different approach to quantifying the most popular platform this time, itâs visible that X-Plane has lost a chunk of its relevance in 2023.  Regarding features most valued in an add-on aircraft, 38% of the respondents said aircraft system complexity, followed by realism and authenticity with 26.6%, and flight model accuracy with 17.4%.  The GPU results for this year were relatively surprising, with the RTX 4090 topping the charts at 14.5%, closely followed by the RTX 3080 at 11.5% and the 3080Ti at 10.3%. The only AMD card from the list is labeled âAMD Radeon,â with 4.5% of the respondents owning a GPU from the red team. Nvidia shows clear dominance in the flight sim realm, reflecting their overall lead in the global GPU market.Â   According to the respondents, the best flight simulation release of the year is the PMDG 737 with 11.2%, even though it was not released in 2023, followed by the Fenix A320 with 9.7%, which also was not released this year. A2A Simulationsâ Comanche 250, released in 2023, is third with 8.8%.Â   The most anticipated products for 2024 are the PMDG 777 (29.2%), Fenix A319/20/21 (12.3%), and the FlyByWire A380 (11.3%). Surprisingly, MSFS 2024 sits at 6.6%. On that Flight Sim 2024 note, respondents were asked about their expectations for the upcoming simulator, and 27.9% said performance optimization, 20.2% said improved graphics and realism, and 16.8% wanted weather engine improvements.Â   To check out the full results, please visitÂ this page.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts, well-known for their lineup of Embraer aircraft for X-Plane, have released an update for their E-Jet series. The update focuses mainly on improvements to the autopilot and FMS but also includes many updates to other parts of the planes.  In a post on the X-Plane.org forums, X-Crafts have outlined the new update that has focused on âminor but annoying issues.â The post also teased a large feature update coming in 2024. The full update list contains almost 100 overall changes, and you can find the full list here, but weâll be focusing on what X-Crafts have listed as the main changes. The main focus of this update has been the flight management and autopilot systems and adding functionality that exists in real-world aircraft including things like FLCH now being limited to +2Â° up while climbing and -7Â° in descent, updated approaches that include X and Y designations allowing for users to be able to follow approaches more accurately. An effort has also been made to help the aircraft run more smoothly overall by changing how often the fuel predictions on the FMS progress page updates. Before the update, it would do the calculation every frame, but now, it has now been changed to every 5 seconds allowing for a load on the CPU. The FMS updates also include some quality-of-life fixes with features like the localiser and ground speed selectors staying active after disconnecting the autopilot. X-Crafts have also made changes to the aircraft systems in preparation for the planned steep approach mode, which includes changes such as improved speed brake indications on the EICAS.  X-Crafts are also offering a time-limited discount for those who have purchased either of the V2.5 E-jets. This offer is only valid throughÂ  May 10th, 2024 and grants a 15% discount towards the purchase of the full E-Jets collection, pricing for the different purchase options can be found on the X-Crafts website.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Golden Key Studio (also known as GKS) have released their rendition of the F-111E Ardvark for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The release comes just days after the most recent update on the projectâs development.  Originally developed by General Dynamics in the early 60's, the F-111E, nicknamed the Aardvark, was a pioneer for the development of features that would become a staple of modern combat aircraft. The Ardvark was the first production aircraft to feature variable-sweep wings. The platform also played a pivotal role in the design of modern after-burning engines. The Aardvark first entered service with the USAF in 1967, and the Australian government later purchased the E variant of the F-111. While the RAAF only ever deployed their F-111s as a deterrent, the USAF flew over 4000 combat missions in both the Vietnam and Gulf Wars. The USAF retired their F-111s in 1996 while the RAAF had theirs in active service until 2010.  âGKS promises users of the F-111 will experience an authentic flight model with impressive graphics and a highly detailed cockpit featuring accurate aircraft systems. GKS has kept the development of the Ardvark pretty quiet overall, and while there isnât a ton of information available on their latest offering it is expected that it will be up to the same standard as their MiG-21.

The entire project is built by the hands of DA42 pilots and student pilots to ensure accuracy in both Microsoft Flight Simulator/FS2024 and XP12. Originating from the late 1990s brainstorming sessions, the DA42 has undergone numerous iterations during its 24-year production span. The latest iteration, the DA42-VI, has gained popularity among consumers as a luxurious four-seater featuring modern construction, materials, and cutting-edge avionics. Additionally, the DA42 has made significant inroads into the flight training market, serving as a robust twin-engine trainer utilized globally to prepare pilots for complex multi-engine aircraft types.Renowned for its efficiency, the DA42 offers unique engine options, such as aerodiesels co-designed with Mercedes-Benz and Austro Engine GmbH. The Austro diesels contribute to a remarkable 46% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to the gasoline models. COWS is currently putting the finishing touches on the project, indicating an imminent release within the next few weeks. While no details regarding pricing or specific vendors have been disclosed at this point, anticipate the release of such information as the project approaches a confirmed launch date. Keep an eye on Threshold for additional updates regarding the release of the COWS DA42-VI!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Parallel 42 has recently released Simstaller for FS2020. The software is designed to detect add-on conflicts and installation issues related to the complexity of installing modifications to the simulation. It is a lightweight standalone application that runs in the background of Windows. Initially, Parallel 42 planned to offer the utility as a payware product but later realized that it was a must-have for users who download from community sites like flightsim.to.   The Virtual File System (VFS) scans and detects issues, alerting you to packages that override critical core operations or unintended game modifications. With Simstaller, you can identify who or what is overriding the functions of the simulation. Simstaller provides welcome relief for individuals fatigued by the constant need to troubleshoot errors and pinpoint the root causes of issues within Microsoft Flight Simulator's community folder. âThe Parallel 42 Simstaller app is available free on parallel42.com. â</summary>

    <title>Fly2High Releases Cartagena Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Rafael NÃºÃ±ez International Airport (SKCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Cartagena, Colombia, with a yearly average of 7.2 million passengers.  It was built in 1946 as Crespo Air Field, with TACA Colombia being the first airline to serve the city, albeit very briefly, as they went under a year later, with LANSA taking the remaining slots.  By 1979, the airport averaged around 99 flights a week, which was not enough in terms of touristic volume for the local hotels, leading to pressure for an airport redevelopment in 1982: a new passenger terminal and a runway extension, allowing for bigger aircraft. It is now the fourth busiest airport in the country.  Itâs a hub for Avianca and served by Air Century, American Airlines, Arajet, Avianca Costa Rica, Clic, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Edelweiss Air, JetBlue, KLM, Latam Colombia, Latam Peru, Spirit, Wingo.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, high-detail buildings, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.37, requiring at least 1.21 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <title>Kiss Simulation Releases Sarajevo International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/659731c1f041642de77632a0_sara.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Kiss Simulation has recently released their rendition of Sarajevo International Airport (LQSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers.  It was built in 1966 and opened for traffic three years later, although domestically. International operations only started a year later, with Frankfurt being its first international destination.Â   The first renovation happened nearly 20 years later for the 1984 Winter Olympics, with a new terminal building, a runway extension, and navigational system improvements.  The terminal was expanded in 2017, with a new 10,000-square-meter building able to handle up to 2 million passengers a year.  Its mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather have led to multiple financial losses over the years, with the most memorable one dating back to December 2015, when over 40% of the flights were canceled. The only way they could fix it would be by moving the threshold an additional 200 meters, which would shorten the runway, which is not ideal given that itâs already relatively short at 2,600 meters.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with the new terminal extension, custom runway profile, real-world ILS profile, custom-made ground textures, up-to-date ground layout, runway weathering, and more.   Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.18, requiring at least 792.15 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>
