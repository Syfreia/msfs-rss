    <summary>Sim: MSFS. ColombiaVFR has recently released CapurganÃ¡ Airport (SKCA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the coastal town of CapurganÃ¡ in Colombia.Â   The city isn't accessible via roads, meaning only airplanes and boats can get there, making the airport an important - and fast - link to the rest of the country.  The airport is operated by the Colombian Civil Aviation Authority and has a small terminal building that provides basic facilities such as check-in counters, waiting areas, and restrooms.  CapurganÃ¡ Airport is known for its scenic location, surrounded by lush tropical forests and crystal-clear waters. The airport is near some of Colombia's most beautiful beaches, including Playa Blanca and El Aguacate. As a result, the airport is a popular destination for tourists who wish to explore the region's natural beauty and enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, snorkeling, and fishing.  Despite its popularity, CapurganÃ¡ Airport has limited flight options, with only a few airlines operating regular flights to and from the airport. The airport is also known for its challenging approach, as the runway is on a narrow strip of land between the sea and the mountains, making landing and takeoff difficult in certain weather conditions.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-detailed custom models, custom clutter, and lots of minor details such as graffiti art (as per real life), an abandoned airplane, and more.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.46, requiring at least 1.61 GB of free hard disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Aerosoft Teases Progress on the A330 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently shared further information on the development of their Airbus A330 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, including a batch of new images, the entrance into a closed beta stage, and more!  Mathijs Kok, Aerosoft's Product Manager, fed theirÂ A330 Preview ThreadÂ with a fresh batch of external imagery of their upcoming widebody, along with the information their beta testers can now send exterior shots of the aircraft. He then described the product's current stage regarding models, textures, animations, flight modeling, FADEC, manuals, autopilot, systems, etc. Description of which follows down below, verbatim: â Modeling, texturing, and almost all animations are solid. No worries about that.Â  In fact, Stefan and Anne are already working on the next bus.Â  Flight modeling, Engine modeling, and FADEC were massive issues, but we are 99% sure we can get within 3% of correct behavior. Any pilot will tell you that is fine as one airframe differs from another. Having two engines on one aircraft that differ by 3% is fine. Don't be mistaken, 3% is pretty much state-of-the-art.Â  Manuals and E-manual are more or less okay. The PDF manuals will be fine and available on release, the E-manual which is one of the highlights of the project as we want to get even beginners to be able to fly the A330 will be available but will need to be updated with the latest changes in code. Autopilot still needs work but is basically not very complex. It flies the route, does a cool ILS intercept, and lands fine. Systems are more or less okay. This is one area where you can spend another 20 years because where the real aircraft just has to display what is happening, we need to model why it happens. So when a computer decides the cabin needs to be heated a bit, a system will divert heat from an engine to a heat exchanger and feed the warmed air to the cabin. That means the engine will be affected, the electrical system will be involved and that means the generators will need to provide a bit more power. And that drops the thrust of the engine. See the complexity? We have a whopping lot of that code running because of some professional spin-offs of the bus projects. It's there and somewhere in Germany, a developer is crying because no customer will ever see it.Â  EFB, we are very proud of the EFB.Â  and while we need some tweaks, all is well. Navigraph, NavDataPro, weather, runway data, simbrief integration, are all working. I just love to be able to update the weather data automatically before planning an arrival, The fact we incorporated our own sat imagery so you can be sure you are doing your taxi route okay.. cool. MCDU, LNAV, VNAV... That is where we have most work open. Logically as it is by far the most complex part of the aircraft. LNAV seems to work, VNAV not so much but we know what we need to do.Â  ECAMS, loads of tweaks in fonts, placement, and things like that open (we had some bad luck in that part) but it is not code that affects flight.Â  Still one of my main worries now. Marketplace. This is the work you need to do to get something on the Marketplace. Not only contracts but a whopping lot of things you have to add. Not complex but I still need a few days on that for sure. Installer/Protection. With our own Aerosoft One system that is tried and tested (our DRM has not been hacked and has next to makes life for the customer easier (no need to enter any serial!s)) we are not worried about that at all.Â  Support, they are fully included in the testing so they should know what they need. Marketing. This department will be getting all information from me very soon.Â  They will invite streamers to have a look at the product before release and get the word out to websites and magazines. Sales still have to make sure that all our associate sale channels get all the marketing data and on release the files.  BaxterChico, one of their testers, has also shared some screenshots:  There's still no information regarding pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed as things progress! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Shadescene has recently released their rendition of Sultan Mahmud Airport (WMKN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Kuala Terengganu in Malaysia with a yearly average of 919,829 passengers as of 2019.  The airport was established in the 1920s as a small airfield, used primarily for military purposes during World War II, serving as a base for the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Japanese Imperial Army.  After the war, the British colonial authorities expanded and upgraded the airport to accommodate civilian air travel. It was renamed Sultan Mahmud Airport in honor of Sultan Mahmud Al-Muktafi Billah Shah, the 16th Sultan of Terengganu.  In the following years, Sultan Mahmud Airport became an important transportation hub for the Terengganu region, connecting it with other parts of Malaysia and neighboring countries. The airport underwent several upgrades and modernizations to keep pace with the region's air travel growth.  In 2008, a major renovation and expansion project was undertaken to upgrade the airport's facilities and increase its capacity. The project included constructing a new terminal building, a new runway, and other airport infrastructure improvements.  Today, Sultan Mahmud Airport is one of the busiest airports in Malaysia, serving as a vital economic driver for the Terengganu region, supporting tourism, trade, and other industries. The airport continues to evolve and expand to meet the growing demand for air travel in Malaysia and the surrounding regions.  It's served by four airlines: AirAsia (Kuala Lumpur-International), Batik Air Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur-Subang), Firefly (Kuala Lumpur-Subang), and Malaysia Airlines (Kuala Lumpur-International).Â   The scenery features a high-detail rendition of the airport, with an accurate replica of the terminal, custom terraforming, custom scenery objects, high-resolution textures, custom jetways, hand-placed taxiways, and runway light system, custom night lighting, and hand-crafted ground markings and textures.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $9.87, requiring at least 544.11 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Asobo Studio has recently released the first aircraft of their high-authenticity focused Expert Series for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the ATR 42-600 and the ATR 72-600, aiming to deliver high fidelity at a lower price bracket.  The ATR lineup is an evolution of the combined effort between two companies: Aerospatiale (now Airbus) and Aeritalia (Leonardo), aiming to build a versatile regional airplane.  TheÂ ATR 42-600Â is a twin-engine, high-wing turboprop seating up to fifty passengers, introduced in late 2012. Itâs an updated ATR 42, the initial combined effort between Airbus and Leonardo in the 1980s. The â42â came from the original seat count.Â   Being a newer airframe, the 42-600 features a Â modern glass cockpit, improved fuel efficiency, and overall performance compared to the older project. It can also take off and land on relatively short runways, making it perfect for regional operations.  TheÂ ATR 72-600Â is a relatively stretched version of the ATR 42-600 with a seating configuration ranging from 70 to 78 seats, with a range of 850 miles, and cruising at 320 miles per hour.  The new ATRs come with seven liveries in total:  42-600  72-600  The ATR Bundle is available on the Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace for $19.99, with a 30% discount for deluxe/premium deluxe owners.
