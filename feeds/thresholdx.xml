    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Miltech Simulations has provided a development update for their Boeing CH-47D Chinook. The update, which was posted to their Facebook page, highlights their recent focus on finishing the 3D model and texturing and also includes some new screenshots of the interior texturing.Â  The CH-47D Chinook is a tandem-rotor transport helicopter first developed by Vertol in 1957 and later manufactured by Boeing. The CH-47D has a maximum take-off weight of 50,000 lbs and a range of 400 nautical miles. Production started on the CH-47 in 1962 and continues to this day.Â  â Miltech also noted some features to be expected upon release of the CH-47 including a fully modeled interior and exterior, multiple cargo types from Humvees to fully animated paratroopers, and a âcomprehensive yet practical renditionâ of the Chinookâs systems. Miltech has been very upfront about some systems being âfor display onlyâ due to Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs limitations. Miltech also promises that an EFB will be included at launch. Another feature that was noted in the update is the inclusion of a soundtrack that is based on recordings from a Chinook. The update included a look at possibilities post-release including an expansion pack that would add other variants of the Chinook including the more modern âFâ variant. Currently, there is no release date set however Miltech states that PC users will see the release first with Xbox following shortly after. The stated reason for the planned delay is due to Microsoft's marketplace verification. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim updates! â</summary>

    <title>Redwings Simulations announces the upcoming release of the Hindenburg</title>
    <updated>2023-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/redwing" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. â Redwings Simulations announces the upcoming release of the Hindenburg via their Facebook page and Discord Channel. Redwings Simulations is known for bringing the Lockheed Super Connie to the Microsoft flight simulator. â The Hindenburg was the largest airship ever designed and built by the German aircraft company Zeppelin. The German Zeppelin Airline Company operated it as a long-range passenger aircraft. The Hindenburg took its first flight on March 4, 1936; during that time, it was the largest aircraft ever built, coming in at nearly 800 feet long, three times the length of the Boeing 747. The LZ-129 carried 140,000 cubic meters of hydrogen. The LZ-129 was propelled through the air by ten Maybach engines, five mounted to the airframe as "engine cars." It could cruise at a maximum speed of 84 miles per hour and cruised at 78 miles per hour.  â The Hindenburg could carry up to 50+ passengers comfortably with spacious amenities. Passengers could reside between two different decks, A and B deck. The accommodation included promenade areas, dining rooms, lounges, a reading/writing room, and 25 cabins available for passengers. The aircraft had a smoking room, a kitchen crew, officer's mess hall, a bar, restrooms, and a pursers' office on B deck. The Hindenburg could travel up to 8,700 miles at around 1,500 feet, flying over 1,000 passengers during its operational lifetime. The Hindenburg took on ocean liners as a new alternative to transatlantic ocean liner travel.  â â Meeting its demise on May 6, 1937, in a fiery crash on approach to the naval facility in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The accident claimed the lives of 36 of the 97 people aboard. To this day, the cause of the explosion is still unknown but is thought to be due to a leak and static discharge from the atmosphere. â âHindenburg relives in Microsoft Flight Simulator thanks to Red WING Simulations. Red WINGS accurately recreated the model in its former glory by covering all the details of the original through accurate modeling and texturing based on blueprint drawings of the actual Hindenburg. The model features functional cockpits and engine decks, modeled decks with crew and passenger areas, and maintenance corridors. PBR texturing is incorporated into texturing as well.  â âThe flight model in Redwings has been designed with airship particularities in mind , with new A.I. roles included. This simulator takes you back to the early days of aviation communication, where Morse code was used. The electrical systems are faithfully recreated in the simulation, allowing you to complete tasks manually or with the assistance of the A.I. â The package will also include mooring mass such as the Empire State Building. Custom world maps for Hindenburg include weather details, drift headings displayed QDM/QDR ground stations, and more.  The flight model incorporates the effects of temperature, windspeeds, atmospheric pressures, ballast, gas volume, and other airship operational variables. The simulation also takes into account the need for repairs and routine maintenance. The package will also include additional liveries. The Hindenburg will be available soon for P.C. and XBOX. There is no official news of a release date yet, but RedWINGS indicates its release to be soon! To find out more, visit RedWINGS Facebook, website and Discord. Check out the launch trailer here on RedWINGS YouTube channel. As usual stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates!  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The Release Candidate One of Update 12.0.8 is now released, addressing several bugs in the simulator, including CTD in certain instances, issues with Better Pushback, and more.  The 12.0.8-rc-1 update has fixed bugs related to the Skyhawk assertion failures when loading the SkyHawk floats on solid ground and crashes when popping up the ATC window at EGPR. Various PNG iCCP warnings with the Zibo 737 and 12.0.08-beta 2 have also been addressed. Better Pushback error has been retitled to "impossible to push back....". Further issues like the rotating tips during loading screens and the performance regression reading "sim/aircraft/view/acf_livery_path" have also been fixed. The erratic catapult behavior of the Aircraft Carrier, which violently snapped aircraft to location when taxing close, has also been resolved.  Furthermore, the freezing mode, which was not working correctly, has also been resolved. All these fixes come after the significant release of version 12.0.8, which includes new engine model improvements, landing gear physics, fuel temperature models, graphics fixes, and more.  You can find more information about the changes in the latest update by watching Austin's update video, in which he discusses the evolution of these features and how they affect flight dynamics and other sim parameters. â As usual stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The highly anticipated Just Flight Vulcan project is now available for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It is the most accurate and detailed recreation of the Avro Vulcan for any Flight Simulation. The Just Flight team has put tremendous effort and resources into the project, gathering hours of data, sounds, and details from the latest surviving airframe. Thanks to the Maintenance and Preservation Society, the Just Flight team gained access to detailed sound recordings, resulting in two engine types of sound sets â the Olympus 200 Series and the Olympus 301 Series engines.  Vulcan's interior is modeled to exact details based on XM655 sampled for this recreation. The cockpit, with hundreds of functional switches, knobs, and controls, is also modeled to perfection. Lighting includes over 25 functioning lighting controls, bringing the ambiance of the real aircraft at night to the simulator. The rear crew panels are also modeled in outstanding detail, as well as the texturing and modeling, which is as close to the real aircraft as possible, with 8k PBR texturing bringing out all of the details from the inside out. The package includes various liveries (19) fitting the time of the Vulcan's service history. The aircraft simulation includes realistic payloads like Blue Steel, 1000-pound bombs, and bomb bay tanks. The bomb bay doors function and are fully animated, along with other animated features such as lift dumpers and the tail-mounted air brake. Further simulations cover the complex electrical, fuel, and engine management systems and CAN and VOR NAV radio systems. Vulcan's flight model has undergone extensive work to bring realistic and accurate flight characteristics to the sim.  Feedback from former Vulcan crewmembers was used to create the most accurate flight model for the sim. Custom effects like compressor exhaust haze, exhaust, and the Houchin GPU bring in the immersive level expected for this historic aircraft. These systems are coded based on real-world manuals. The operations and EFB manuals can be downloaded from the links below. The Vulcan sales for 32.99 on Just Flights website.  Operations Manual  EFB manual  Just Flight has published extensive video coverage of the model on their YouTube page, which you can check out below! â As usual stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news and updates!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. In their latest monthly developer livestream on Twitch, Microsoft has announced World Update XVI, along with the upcoming Famous Flyer, and other details about Sim Update 14. The one and a half hour long stream also covered some new features coming to Sim Update 15 as well as the upcoming World Hub. â Starting with the World Update, it was announced that the focus area for the upcoming update would be the Caribbean, specifically Â This update will feature new Digital Elevation Maps, new aerial imagery, and new technology that brings the bright blue shallow waters around the islands to the sim. There will also be 3 new bush trips, 3 landing challenges, and 3 discovery flights. On the scenery side, Microsoft and Asobo are again working with Gaya Simulations to bring over 100 points of interest and seven new bespoke airports to the sim. The seven new airports included are Vilo AcuÃ±a, Puerto Plata, Antoine-Simon Airport, Crown Point, Sangster, North Eleuthera, and Les Saintes.  During the stream, Microsoft also revealed that the Famous Flyer 8 will be the Cessna 207. Developed in partnership with Carenado, the Cessna 207 will be released along with Sim Update 14, which comes out in just a few days. The Cessna 207 is known for its expanded seating capacity of up to seven people, and the popular design language borrowed from the Cessna 172. Not much about the features included in the Carenado 207 have been announced as of the time of writing, but it will feature high-quality textures and multiple variants of the C207. The team at Microsoft and Asobo also covered some additional information about the upcoming release of Sim Update 14. Multiple topics were covered, such as the new snow coverage system, the highly-requested improvements to the atmospheric lighting system, the avionics overhaul for the Cirrus SR-22 by Working Title, and many fixes and improvements. They also shared new previews for the sun and ozone changes. There was also an extensive section covering a new update to ground handling. Microsoft and Asobo were able to accomplish this by taking some of the physics model changes from the rewritten engine for the upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to MSFS 2020. This allows the airframe to shake and respond to forces such as moving control surfaces and engine vibration. For the developers out there, theyâre going to be adding a new parameter to define the flexibility of the airframe. This update is set to launch with the release of Sim Update 15. â Finally, the team shared a new preview image of MSFS 2024, showing what looks like a beautiful rendition of the Grand Canyon in the United States. â You can watch the full stream on the Official Microsoft Flight Simulator Twitch channel here. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released their rendition of MÃ¡laga-Costa del Sol Airport (LEMG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in Spain with a yearly average of 18.4 million passengers, only behind Madrid, Barcelona, and Palma de Mallorca.  â Itâs one of Spainâs oldest airports, dating back to 1919, with scheduled air service starting that same year with Didier Daurat flying passengers to Barcelona, Toulouse, Alicante, Tangier, and Casablanca. â The runway had its first extension work in 1960, followed by the construction of a new passenger terminal at the very center of the site. â â In 1991, a new passenger terminal (now Terminal 2) was opened, designed by Ricardo Boffil. The old one was converted into a general aviation terminal four years later. â Terminal 3 was opened by King Juan Carlos in March 2010, starting operations a day after the ceremony. â Only two of the three terminals are currently operating (Terminals 2 and 3). Terminal 2 is low-cost oriented and hosts EasyJet, EasyJet Switzerland, and Ryanair, and Terminal 3 is used by the other airlines. â Being one of the busiest airports in Spain, the list of operators is substantial: itâs a focus city for EasyJet, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, and Vueling, and most European carriers regularly visit it. London Gatwick is the busiest destination, with an average of 885,608 passengers, and Barcelona is a close second with 778,527. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, LiDAR-based elevation data, custom ground polygons, handcrafted 3D models, realistic lighting, AI compatibility, and custom interiors.  â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ andÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $18.13/18.51, requiring at least 1.32 GB of free hard disk space to install.
