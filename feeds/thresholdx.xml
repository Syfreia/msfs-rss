    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. DarkBlueScenery has recently released their rendition of Chubu Centrair International Airport (RJGG) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving the city of Nagoya with a yearly average of 12 million passengers.  Serving the third largest metropolitan area in the country, Centrair was built to alleviate traffic into the former Nagoya Airport (now Nagoya Airfield) and redirect some of the cargo shipments that were initially directed to Tokyo or Kansai.Â   Construction work started in late 2000, reaching completion five years later at 668 billion yen. With a single runway and 42 gates, it is divided between two terminals, one for the major carriers and the second one for budget airlines. There are plans to add two new runways: a parallel runway by 2027 and a runway on the airport's west side that would replace the current runway.  It's a hub for All Nippon Airways and Jetstar Japan and features a strong presence of Japan Airlines and Polar Air Cargo. The visitors' list includes Air Busan, Air China, Asiana Airlines, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, Cebu Pacific, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Etihad Airways, Jeju Air, Korean Air, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and United Airlines.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a realistic 3D model of the passenger terminals, custom ground service equipment, performance-friendly optimization, and more. The developer recommends using X-Plane 12 to have the best experience possible.  It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.28, requiring at least 492.42 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently announced their next project for X-Plane 11 and 12: a rendition of Faro International Airport (LPFR), serving the city of Faro in Algarve, Portugal, with a yearly average of 8 million passengers. It was inaugurated in 1965 by then president AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s, with a government-owned DC-3 being the first airplane ever to touch its runway, followed by TAP Air Portugalâs Lockheed Super Constellation, transporting government officials and important guests. Scheduled passenger service started two days after, connecting Faro to Lisbon. In that same year, the airport recorded 58,000 passengers. Faro has only seen two significant developments in its first 40 years: a new passenger terminal building in 1989, and its eventual enlargement in 2001, to cope with the increased demands for air travel. The 2010s brought even more pressure for expansion, which reached completion in 2013 after a two-phase work, increasing its passenger handling capacity from six million to eight million passengers. Minor expansion work went on over the remainder of the decade, with the airport now able to handle up to 9 million passengers a year, with 22 stands and 36 boarding gates.  Itâs a base for EasyJet and Ryanair, flying to many European destinations. The visitorsâ list includes many traditional European airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Scandinavian, and TAP Air Portugal and popular low-cost carriers such as Condor, Eurowings, Jet2, Smartwings, and Wizz Air. Thereâs no release date or pricing information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RDPresets has recently teased their upcoming rendition of Faro International Airport (LPFR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Faro in Algarve, Portugal, with a yearly average of 8 million passengers. In 1965, Faro Airport was officially inaugurated by then-president AmÃ©rico TomÃ¡s. The historic moment was marked by the landing of a government-owned DC-3 aircraft, followed by TAP Air Portugal's Lockheed Super Constellation, which transported government officials and esteemed guests. Two days later, scheduled passenger service commenced, connecting Faro to Lisbon, and the airport welcomed approximately 58,000 passengers in its first year. During its initial four decades of operation, Faro Airport experienced two notable developments: a new passenger terminal in 1989 and its first expansion in 2001. However, it was during the 2010s that the pressure for growth became even more significant, leading to a comprehensive expansion project that reached completion in 2013 through a two-phase approach. The project increased the airport's passenger capacity from six million to eight million. Additional minor expansion work took place throughout the decade, resulting in the current capability of handling up to 9 million passengers annually. The airport boasts 22 stands and 36 boarding gates. Faro Airport is a base for popular airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair, offering flights to numerous European destinations. The airport's list of visitors includes traditional European carriers such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, and TAP Air Portugal.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ESSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the province of Uppland in Sweden with a yearly average of 26 million passengers. Itâs the busiest airport in the country and the third busiest in Scandinavia.  Opened in 1962, it quickly replaced Stockholm Bromma as the countryâs main international airport due to its longer runway, allowing SAS to utilize the DC-8 for flights to North America. It was mainly an international airport during its first decades, with most domestic flights operating out of Bromma.Â   In 1983, Linjeflyg, a former domestic airline, moved from Bromma to Arlanda, operating their domestic routes on Terminal 4. A few years later, the airport got two new terminals exclusively for domestic use.Â   The airport currently features four terminals, three in use as of 2022, with no separation between domestic and international flights.Â   Itâs a hub for Scandinavian Airlines and Eurowings Europe and a focus city for Finnair, Novair, and Ryanair. London is the most popular European destination, with nearly 2 million passengers shared between Heathrow and Gatwick, followed by Copenhagen with 1,394,000.Â   The scenery, developed by one of their independent developers, Marcus Nyberg, features animated jetways, functional and correct VDGS, enhanced interiors for all terminals, high-quality custom GSE, animated vehicles, weather-influenced snowbanks, a high-resolution mesh, and a custom GSX profile.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $24.01, requiring at least 6.35 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Orbx Releases Melbourne Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-06-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/orbmel" rel="alternate"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Melbourne Airport (YMML) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Melbourne in Australia with a yearly average of 25 million passengers. It is the second busiest airport in the country!  Built in the 60s and opened in 1970, it replaces Essendon Airport (Orbxâs home) as the cityâs main airport due to its relatively short runways, small terminals, and its expansion limitations that were a consequence of the urban development around the area.Â   During its first year of operations, Melbourne only handled international traffic, handling 155,275 international passengers that year and six airlines.Â   It originally featured three connected terminals, an international at the center, a terminal for Ansett to the south, and one for Trans Australia Airlines to the north. It could withstand 8 Boeing 707s and a rate of 500 passengers per hour, with expansion work three years later to comport the Boeing 747.  It wasnât long until the passenger figures increased drastically, forcing further expansion: the Ansett terminal, domestic, got bigger, followed by an upgrade to the international terminal in 1993 and the opening of a new three-level concourse in 1995, with ten additional jetways.  In 1997, Melbourne was privatized, on a 50-year long-term lease, followed by a series of upgrades and improvements, including the construction of a multi-story carpark with 3,100 parking spaces, a 276-room hotel, and the expansion of the Qantas domestic terminal with a second pier and nine additional stands.  In 2005, the airport underwent more construction work to become A380-ready, with a runway widening, the addition of dual jetbridges, a terminal extension, and a subsequent expansion of terminal 2 in 2006 and 2008, massively increasing its passenger handling capabilities.  The airport has 68 gates, 53 used for domestic operations and 15 for international.Â   The airport is a hub for Jetstar (Adelaide, Auckland, Ayers Rock, Ballina, BangkokâSuvarnabhumi, Brisbane, Busselton, Cairns, Canberra, Christchurch, Darwin, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Hobart, Ho Chi Minh City, Honolulu, Launceston, Newcastle, Perth, Phuket, Proserpine, Queenstown, Singapore, Sunshine Coast, Sydney, Townsville), Qantas (Adelaide, Alice Springs, Auckland, Ballina, Brisbane, Broome, Cairns, Canberra, Christchurch, Dallas/Fort Worth, Darwin, Delhi, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Â Hamilton Island, Hobart, Hong Kong, JakartaâSoekarno-Hatta, LondonâHeathrow, Los Angeles, Perth, Queenstown, Singapore, Sunshine Coast, Sydney, Wellington), Rex Airlines (Adelaide, Brisbane, Burnie, Canberra, Devonport, Gold Coast, King Island, Merimbula, Mildura, Mount Gambier, Sydney, Wagga Wagga), and Virgin Australia (Adelaide, Ballina, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, Darwin, Denpasar, Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Hobart, Launceston, Nadi, Newcastle, Perth, Queenstown, Sunshine Coast, Sydney). The visitor list includes Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, LATAM Chile, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, and more.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, PBR texturing, interior terminal modeling of departure lounges, VDGS, custom traffic animations, crisp satellite imagery, custom ground clutter, custom POIs, LOD optimization, and a custom GSX profile.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $23.92, requiring at least 6.77 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Developer Simworks Studios, renowned for their rendition of the Kodiak 100 for MSFS has recently provided a development update on their Discord and Facebook regarding the RV-10/14, Okavango delta, and their PC-12. â In light of the recent Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 announcement, SimWorks Studios has stated that as their existing add-ons follow the guidelines of the MSFS SDK, they believe that they will work fine in FS2024. They will update the installers to give users the option between MSFS2020 and MSFS2024 and users should be able to use the existing products without any paid upgrades. However, it's worth noting that if an add-on takes advantage of the new features exclusive to FS2024, such as the ability to perform specialized tasks, SimWorks Studios may choose to charge extra for such expansions. For example, if an aircraft like the Kodiak 100 requires additional work to enable the dropping of parachutists, an expansion product might be introduced with an associated cost. Nevertheless, if the existing add-ons continue to function flawlessly in FS2024 without any modifications, users can enjoy the enhancements without any additional charges. â In other news, developers have announced updates for the RV-10 and RV-14 aircraft, addressing minor code bugs and compatibility issues. The RV-10 update specifically focuses on resolving problems with the PMS50 GTN650 and GTN750, while the RV-14 update improves ground handling for the taildragger variant in the Microsoft Store version. These updates are expected to be available next week, benefiting both Microsoft Store and other vendors. â Furthermore, the much-anticipated update for Okavango Delta is set to arrive next week. This update brings a total of 14 new airstrips to the region, including Chitabe FBME, Delta FBDT, Kanana FBKK, Khwai FBKR, Mapula FBND, Ntswi FBND and camp, Pom Pom FBNO, Rann FBMQ, Sanctuary FBMB, Seronga FBSH, Shakawe FBSW, Shindi FBMJ and camp, Xaxaba FBXB and camp, and Xugana FBXG. Alongside the new airstrips, the update introduces hundreds of traveling animals, which exhibit realistic behavior, including running away if approached too closely. Additionally, minor fixes have been made to existing camps and airstrips, as well as improvements to animal LOD switching. â A sneak peek at the PC-12 interior textures has been unveiled, showcasing the level of detail and customization options available. The textures for both the cockpit and cabin are being refined and improved, allowing for a fully customizable experience.Â  â Repainters will appreciate the flexibility provided, as changing a few small textures will completely refurbish the cabin's look. The advantage of this approach is that it doesn't require large 4k textures for every livery, keeping the package size manageable. The cabin has already undergone significant changes, with a new kind of wood and carpeting, demonstrating the level of customization available to users. The developers have put great effort into ensuring that the textures and details of the PC-12's interior are of the highest quality. Turning our attention to the exterior of the aircraft, the model has undergone a final cleanup to add missing details and correct placements of various items. Flap actuators have been remodeled and animated, further enhancing the realism of the aircraft. The exterior is currently undergoing a final pass to ensure all aspects meet the highest standards and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. â So far no release date has been announced for the highly anticipated PC-12 however when we find out we will inform you here at Threshold.Â  â â â â â</summary>

Hype Performance Group has taken to their Twitter page to announce the suspension of sales regarding their recently released 747 Supertanker.Â  The Hype Performance Group 747 Supertanker which was released just a few days ago, allowed users to take control of the 747 Supertanker and put out wildfires and help resolve an array of other disasters such as maritime oil spills.

    <title>Just Flight Announces Airbus A300B4 for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently uploaded a YouTube video announcing the development of an Airbus A300B4 for Microsoft Flight Simulator and teasing some of the already finished work.   The upcoming add-on will feature highly detailed exterior models with two engine variants, cargo and passenger configs, realistic animations (dynamic wingflex, flaps, and spoilers), and more.  The systems (hydraulic, electrical, fuel, and pressurization) will be custom coded based on the aircraftâs manual, and the navigation systems will include a custom INS and FMC, and options for an AFCS (Automatic Flight Control System) panel and the A300âs N1 limit computer and autothrottle.  The cockpit will feature all three positions (pilot, first officer, and flight engineer), realistically reproduced, texturized (4K and 8K), and modeled with animated and functional switches, knobs, and levers.  The A300B4 was the long-range version of the A300, which became the first ETOPS-compliant aircraft in 1977, just two years after its launch, becoming an interesting option for overwater routes and quickly becoming a favorite of many Asian airlines.  Thereâs no release date or pricing information, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

The ânewâ terminal was expanded between 2011 and 2013 to 36,100 square meters, sporting 24 departure gates, none of which have jetways.Â   Itâs a hub for Ryanair (Alghero, AmmanâQueen Alia, Athens, Barcelona, Bari, Beauvais, Berlin, Billund, Brindisi, BucharestâOtopeni, Budapest, Cagliari, Catania, Charleroi, Cologne/Bonn, Copenhagen, Crotone, Dublin, Edinburgh, Eindhoven, FÃ¨s, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, KrakÃ³w, Lamezia Terme, Lanzarote, Lisbon, LondonâLuton, LondonâStansted, Madrid, MÃ¡laga, Malta, Manchester, Marseille, Nuremberg, Palermo, Paphos, Porto, Prague, Santander, Santiago de Compostela, Seville, Sofia, StockholmâArlanda, Tel Aviv, TenerifeâSouth, Thessaloniki, Trapani, Valencia, Vienna, WarsawâModlin, WrocÅaw, Zaragoza) and Neos (Marsa Alam, Sharm El Sheikh, TenerifeâSouth), and visited by a comprehensive list of carriers such as Aegean, Air France, British Airways, Emirates, Eurowings, Finnair, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP, and more.Â   The scenery features a high-fidelity rendition of the airport, with an accurately modeled terminal and its interior, landside buildings, custom GSE vehicles, performance-friendly optimization, and compatibility with most AI traffic plugins.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.20, requiring at least 1.09 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
