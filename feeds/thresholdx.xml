    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Leonardo Software House has recently released an update to their Maddog for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing feature parity with the P3D version by adding ACARS, CPDLC, integration with SimBrief and GSX Pro, and several bug fixes. The changelog follows down below: â ******1.1b123 - 27/11/2022****** MSFS2020 edition â &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[NEW] - GSX Pro integration; - Simbrief integration for automatic download of latest OFP from EFB; â &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[FIXED] SYSTEMS - fixed issue with autoland align mode; - fixed issue that caused FMS in descent to slow down to 250kt below FL100 even if restriction was cancelled; - fixed issue in Load Manager where in some cases routes created with the LM where not availables as coroute in the FMS; - fixed issue with cockpit flood light; - fixed issue in fms not loading approaches in certain airports; - cabin pax light now dimmed also when seat belt switch on, reduced lights when dimmed (when off ground); - improved holdings; - added all missing ACARS pages; - added weather clients for METAR/ATIS (VATSIM/IVAO) and CPDLC; - added printing of ACARS message to physical printer or Pushover app; - OFP selection in EFB is now from a sorted list of files; EFFECTS - fixed issue with effects with latest MSFS version; - reworked contrails effect; 3D MODEL - fixed hole in the upper left vc window border; - fixed issue with missing reflections in instruments glass; DOCUMENTATION - updated User Manual, Quick Guide and EFB Manual; OTHER - added tray application MDClient to overcome limitation of the sandboxed environment; - removed routes folder from the aircraft folder, the common routes folder under Maddog X Files it is now used; - moved PM calls and attendant voices to the 'VOICES' slider in MSFS; - improved first-load MSFS compile time. AsÂ previously stated,Â the integration took a while because they had to develop a âbridgeâ to interact with the sandboxed environment of Microsoft Flight Simulator, allowing it to communicate with external applications. According to their statement, the âbreakoutâ will also pave the way for future expansions and a return to normal development pace.Â  The Maddog is available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $77.81, requiring at least 298 MB of free disk space to install.Â  Credits to Saffa-Jake on Discord for the scoop, and the images are courtesy of thoar.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Lamezia Terme International Airport (LICA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the principal airport of Calabria, with a yearly average of 3 million passengers. Regularly visited by ITA, Ryanair, Edelweiss, easyJet, and WizzAir, the traffic peaks during the summer, where other airlines also fly down to Calabria, such as Air Transat, Austrian, Condor, Eurowings, Finnair, Smartwings and Transavia.Â   The airport opened in June 1976, with the first modernization and expansion happening in 1982. Recently, the runway was extended from the original 2,414 meters to 3,017 meters. In 2008, Engco won a competition to design a newÂ passenger terminal, aiming to expand the limited capacity of the old one, which grew unable to handle such volume. The idea was to build the new one while progressively demolishing the old terminal, keeping both functioning simultaneously until the progress was finally complete. Due to lack of funding, the plans never came to fruition.Â   The scenery features a detailed representation of the entire airport area, with an up-to-date layout (as of October 2022) featuring the new extended apron and the runway extension, custom static aircraft (an AB 412 and a Canadair CL-415 that operate at the airport), projected mesh groundpoly, custom GSE and clutter, an animated radar, and custom taxi signs and approach lighting.Â   Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $16.49, requiring at least 2.79 GB of free disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flight Sim Development Group has just released their rendition of Bremen Airport (EDDW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city and state of Bremen in Northern Germany with a yearly average of 2.5 million passengers. The route network is mostly intra-european, served by airlines such as Corendon, Eurowings, KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SundAir, Turkish, and WizzAir.Â   The airport was built in the early 1900s, when a local aerospace club ran a couple experimental flights at the site that would then become Bremen Airport. It was then transformed into a military airport during WW1, with a reopening in 1920, when KLM had a scheduled flight to Amsterdam. In the 1930s, it was repurposed as military airfield, serving as a training base for the Luftwaffe, housing a squadron of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 bombers between late-1939 and mid-1940. It was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed, repaired in 1945, when the US Army took over and repurposed it as an airbase, only to be handed back in 1949.  The scenery features an accurate representation of Bremen Airport, with fully customized vehicles and facilities, realistic light environment and interior modeling, seasonal changes, reflective textures, compatible with GSX and Landmarks of Germany, including a custom GSX profile and a user manual.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Orbx has recently made aÂ forum postÂ teasing some of the features of the upcoming Volanta 1.4 update, which includes a mobile app, a new - and updated - flight schedule source, and a stream overlay. There is no information regarding a release date yet, but it is said to be coming soon. TheÂ mobile appÂ will allow premium users to track their flights remotely with statistics, route map, and the possibility to remotely pause the flight (P3D, X-Plane and FSX only). It acts as an extension of the Desktop application, and easening tasks such as taxiing, thanks to taxiway labels and gate information, specially for users with just one monitor.Â  Itâs going to be available on the App Store and Google Play once 1.4 is out.Â   TheÂ new flight schedule sourceÂ is FlightAware, increasing the quality and quantity of the data available, with reliability on the flight number, aircraft type, etc.Â  TheÂ stream overlayÂ will provide a dynamically updated and customizable overlay for streamers, with information such as callsign, departure, arrival, ETA, ground speed and vertical speed.Â   TheÂ Discord Rich PresenceÂ is also getting a revamp, with more information shown, such as simulator in use, aircraft type, and a button that takes you straight to the flight on Volantaâs website. â  The built-in roster system, introduced on Volanta 1.2, has been improved, allowing users to schedule flights outside the real-world scheduling system, making it possible to plan out your entire daily schedule or maybe that long sought after world tour. They conclude the announcement with the information that there is more to come, currently being worked on.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Northern Sky Studio has recently released their rendition of Juneau International Airport (PAJN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving a city with no direct road access to the outside world, making it extremely important for the townsfolk to get around. Itâs a regional hub for all air travel, ranging from tiny carriers to big players such as Alaska Airlines. According to 2020 statistics, the yearly average is around 300,000 passengers. Alaska Airlines comprehends 87% of the yearly traffic figures, transporting people to six destinations (Anchorage, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Seattle-Tacoma, Sitka, and Yakutat). The other 13% are shared between minor regional airlines such as Alaska Seaplanes and Harris Air. The scenery features a detailed replica of the airport, with custom surroundings, PBR materials, shading and occlusion on all buildings, high-resolution textures, native gITF models, and custom ortophoto for the airport and surrounding areas. Itâs available on SimMarket and OrbxDirect for roughly $17.95 and $18.11, respectively. At least 5.47 GB of free disk space is required to install the product.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
