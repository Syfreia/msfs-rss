    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Microsoft has released the first installment of the Aircraft &amp; Avionics update for Microsoft Flight Simulator, addressing several key issues in the game, along with major upgrades to the GNS 430W/GNS 530 W GPS units, and revamped avionics on many of the default aircraft.  The update resolves a problem with unflyable helicopters when users had the legacy flight model realism settings set to less than 100%. It also repairs a control loss issue with the Pitch axis on helicopters when the anti-stall assist was turned on. The update also addresses the issue of snow covering 100% of airport tarmac and roads, as well as fixing the problem with the deletion of VOR, NDB, and waypoints every time the DeleteNavAtAirport was used. Additionally, the update resolves an issue with secondary aerials being overridden by Bing aerial on terrain with photogrammetry and fixes the terrain level of detail issue on Xbox.  The GNS 430W/GNS 430W GPS units were massively upgraded, introducing a comprehensive visual overhaul that provides a more accurate font, symbology, look, operation, and feel. The update also brings advanced flight plan support, including the ability to handle complex departure, arrival, and approach procedures such as arcs, holds, procedure turns, and more, all with correct real-unit limitations. The GPS system now supports full RNAV simulation, including LPV, LP, LNAV/VNAV, and +V vertical guidance during approaches. Additionally, the GPS satellite and SBAS simulation have been improved, with real satellite positions based on orbital mechanics and accurate SBAS coverage areas. The VNAV profile calculator page and associated reminders/alerts have also been added, along with support for missed approaches and missed approach holds. The system also includes a fully specification-accurate ADS-B-based Traffic Avoidance System, more accurate map symbology, procedure previews, and the ability to enter waypoints, navaids, and direct-tos via keyboard. Customization options, such as metric/imperial unit settings and map data field settings, found on real units are also available. The update also includes satellite weather overlay support (NEXRAD). These units have been added to the following aircraft in AAU1:   The avionics system of the Cessna Citation CJ4 underwent a major upgrade to provide a more authentic and immersive experience for pilots. The visual aspect of the system has been completely overhauled to accurately reflect the look, feel, and operation of the CJ4 avionics. The system now supports independent MFD and FMS operation, advanced flight plan features, and a VNAV system with customizable constraints and smoothing. The autopilot system has also been upgraded with additional armable modes, and the aircraft features a full specification-accurate TCAS II traffic system. Other improvements include a complete Crew Alerting System, accurate takeoff and landing speed calculations, integrated engine FADEC systems, and enhanced display modes. The flight model has also been improved, with enhancements to takeoff and landing performance, fuel consumption accuracy, and handling. In addition, the engine and interior sound effects have been refined to provide a more realistic experience.  The Garmin G3000 and G5000 Avionics Suites have been updated to offer a comprehensive and realistic avionics experience. The visual aspect of the system has been overhauled with accurate font, symbology, and operation, and includes a faithful representation of the Garmin Touch Controller (GTC) complete with UI animations. The flight plan support has been advanced to include features like arcs, radius-to-fix, intercepts, holds, and procedure turns. Custom waypoints, including lat/lon, point/bearing/distance, and present position, are also supported. The VNAV system has been improved with two (aircraft-dependent) styles of coupling: Simple VNAV with descent path VNAV only and advanced VNAV with climb constraint and descent path VNAV, editable constraints, and vertical path smoothing. The PFDs and MFDs have full split-pane support, and the system includes a comprehensive traffic system implementation with Garmin TIS, TAS, and TCAS-II. The avionics suite also supports multiple layout styles, including horizontal or vertical GTCs, and offers a multitude of customization options including measurement units, V-speed bugs, and HSI moving map. The system has JavaScript plugin support for loading custom displays, navigation, and pages, and simulates aircraft systems and instrument styling. Additionally, the system includes AHRS alignment and startup sequence.  The complete changelog is availableÂ here. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Established developers iniBuilds have just now revealed their latest project, the famous Antonov AN-225 for Microsoft flight simulator. The Antonov An-225 Mriya was a Ukrainian six-engined super-heavy cargo aircraft, and one of the most significant cargo aircraft in the world. Developed by the Antonov Design Bureau, it was initially designed to transport the Soviet space shuttle and has since been used to transport oversized cargo, including disaster relief supplies, industrial equipment, and even military hardware. The news, which was revealed in a Livestream has shed light on the expected release date and other details about the upcoming aircraft. INI has stated that their intended release date for PC is around the 27th of February with the Xbox version coming around the same time as Sim update 12. The significance of the intended release date is to line up with the date that the real AN225 was destroyed in the ongoing war. Microsoft has also revealed that the aircraft will cost around $20 with all proceeds going toward assisting in the rebuild of the mighty AN225 in real life. It was also revealed that iniBuilds had the opportunity to meet the crew of the real AN225 in order to prepare the upcoming release and make it as realistic as possible.Â  The aircraft will feature a detailed model of both the exterior and interior along with an incredibly in-depth payload system which will allow detailed payload configurations, this will be managed through an EFB-type system. We can see from the images revealed in the live stream just how far along the project is, and how stunning it looks.Â  Threshold will endeavour to keep you updated as we learn more information!Â  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently issued an update to their Douglas DC-6 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, including the new Working Title GNS 430, flight model and autopilot improvements, and other bug fixes.Â   The Douglas DC-6 is a piston-powered airliner and cargo aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company from 1946 to 1958, intended as a military transport near the end of WW2, but was eventually reworked to enter the commercial transport market, a task which was done rather successfully with over 700 units built. With its 2400hp radial engines, the DC-6B could fly nonstop from the eastern United States to Europe but required a fuel stop on the way back because of the winds.Â   The new update is currently available on PMDGâs Operations Center, with the marketplace edition still pending approval by Microsoft. As mentioned by Randazzo in theÂ update announcement post, many of the changes are small and focused on details, with the highlights being the implementation of the Working Title GNS 430 for the GPS and autopilot, flight model stability alterations and improvements, autopilot tuning, the increment of resolution and sharpness of some overhead panel placards, and more. The complete list follows down below: â â  The DC-6 is available on theÂ PMDG StoreÂ and the in-game Marketplace for $59.99.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released the Maasai Mara Safari Pack for Microsoft Flight Simulator, featuring four airstrips, nine safari camps, multiple POIs, fauna, and more!  Maasai Mara is a large national reserve in Narok, Kenya, bordering the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. Itâs one of the most famous and important wildlife conservation areas in Africa. Itâs also where one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa takes place: the Great Migration, part of USA TodayâsÂ New Seven Wonders.Â   Its original coverage upon establishment encompassed 520 square kilometers of land, later extended to 1,821 square kilometers and converted into a game reserve. In 1974, part of it was returned to local communities, which happened again in 1976. The total area has been the same since 1984, with 1,510 square kilometers of land.Â   The aforementioned local community, the Maasai people, is mostly pastoralist, relying on their land to sustain their cattle and themselves. Back in the day, before the conception of the reserve, they were often forced to move off their own land.  iniSceneâs pack brings the Maasai Mara experience into the simulator, with four enhanced airfields that include spawnable helipads (HKOA - Mara Serena, HKKH - Kichwa Tembo, HKLP - Angama Mara, and HK48 - Musiara), nine safari camps, hand-placed fauna across a wide area (including elephants, giraffes, and flamingos), and custom 3D objects including tents, campsites, clutter, and people.  Itâs available for free on the iniBuilds Store, requiring at least 0.98 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flysimware has recently released their rendition of the Nieuport 24 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a WW1 biplane from France. First flown in 1917, the Nieuport 24 is a development of the successful Nieuport 17, made to be small and lightweight, which granted it some nimbleness compared to most of the adversaries, that is, up until the arrival of the SPAD VII and Albatros D.III, which were larger, heavier, but also faster and with a new tactical approach which consisted on even bigger combat formations. Despite it all, they were 310 out of 754 aircraft in the French army as of November 1917.  The developers state itâs a ported product, meaning it was previously released for either FSX or P3D, but remastered with model and texture improvements, and new flight dynamics. Features like an interactive checklist, icing effects, and saved state will be absent to allow faster porting. In return, they claim to charge a lower fee, which is said to correspond to a fraction of the original price.  The aircraft add-on features an accurate model of the Nieuport 24 with 4K PBR textures, realistic flight dynamics, realistic Wwise sounds, custom-coded gauges and animations, a high-quality animated pilot, and parking mode with chocks and removable engine nacelle, along with six unique liveries. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $14.97, requiring at least 429 MB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. NZA Simulations has recently previewed their progress on Christchurch International Airport (NZCH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the third busiest airport in New Zealand with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  Located in Harewood, a northwestern suburb of Christchurch, it officially opened in May 1940, as RNZAF Station Harewood. Six years later, it already had a small terminal building, and basic infrastructure for passenger traffic, which eventually led to its clearance to operate internationally, granted in 1950. It was New Zealandâs first international airport.  The current runway layout was conceived in 1953, with runway 2/20 being around 2,000m and 11/29 at nearly 1,800m. The length was just enough for TEALâs DC-6 aircraft to operate on their trans-Tasman service in 1954. The sudden surge in passenger figures led to the construction of a new terminal, designed by Paul Pascoe, and inaugurated in 1960. Runways were extended in the mid-60s to conform to Boeing 707 standards, used by Qantas on the route to Sydney. The main runway underwent further extension work in 1984 to the current total of 3,287 meters. The airport is served by 12 airlines, with direct flights to 18 domestic and 11 international destinations, with 1057 weekly flights (as of 2015). Itâs a hub for Air New Zealand, with a network of domestic legs and four international destinations in Australia. The developers claim it has entered final testing, with external testers and partners receiving their release candidate versions. The release date is still unknown, but they aim to line it up with the upcoming New Zealand World Update XII.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Palm Beach International Airport (KPBI) for X-Plane 11 and 12, the primary airport of Palm Beach County, serving Wellington, Delray Beach, Boynton Beach, Jupiter, and Palm Beach Gardens. Itâs the third busiest airport in the Miami Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 7 million passengers.  Its origins date back to 1936 when it opened as Morrison Field, named after Grace Morrison, a key planner of the airfield. The first flight to ever depart from it was an Eastern Air Lines DC-2 heading to New York that same year. Not soon after, in 1937, it was expanded beyond an airstrip, with the construction of hangars, and its first terminal: the Eastern Air Lines Terminal. It took a major role during WW2 as a training base (and staging, later on) for the Allied invasion of France, with anÂ en masseÂ departure towards the United Kingdom to join the D-Day invasion of Normandy. It was later returned to Palm Beach County, with its current name being officially adopted in 1948, although not for long, as it was once again transformed into an Air Force Base in 1951, training airmen for the Korean War.  In 1962, the Air Force decided to close the AFB, and it once again became Palm Beach International Airport. Delta Air Lines began their scheduled flights a couple of years prior, followed by Capital Airlines. After local voters rejected a proposal to relocate the airport in detriment of an expansion, PBI got an eight-gate main terminal on the northeastern side of the airport in 1966, with Delta eventually moving into its own terminal in 1974, with six-gates and featuring the airportâs first jetways. Fourteen years later, the airport got another terminal, with 25 gates. It was named after David McCampbell, a WW2 ace. It was considered to be among the finest in the United States by the readers of the Conde Nast Traveller Magazine. Further expansion work followed in 2006, with the construction of a seven-story parking garage and three gates in concourse c.Â   As of 2018, the airport has 32 gates, with Concourse A housing Bahamasair and Silver Airways, Concourse B housing Air Canada, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines, and Concourse C hosting Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, and Spirit Airlines. JetBlue is responsible for 25.37% of the market share, with 1,362,000 passengers, followed by Delta and American, with 21.65% and 21.09%, respectively.  The scenery features detailed 3D models of the airport, terminal, and surrounding buildings, with high-quality PBR textures, realistic night lighting, custom ground service equipment, custom animated SAM jetways, animated radar systems, and an updated layout matching 2022 standards, along with integration with TrueEarth Florida (X-Plane 11 only).  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $20.41, requiring at least 3.27 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimNord has recently released their rendition of Sindal Airport (EKSN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the northernmost airport in Denmark. Itâs a municipal airport, first established in 1977 and home to the Sindal Flying Club.  With a 1,199-meter-long paved runway, Sindal is the ideal playground for general aviation aircraft and small business jets. It functions as a conventional airport during working hours, and as a self-service airport when closed (with prior permission required). Itâs ready for IMC conditions with ILS on runway 26 and NDB on runway 08.  On a curious note, the airport hosts the âCar of the Year in Europeâ test, also referred to as the Tannis test, where vehicles get tested in evasive maneuvers and safety systems. Itâs held every year in September. Sindal Airport also hosts street racing (occasionally, under rental) on a 402-meter-long circuit.  The scenery features an accurate representation of the airport as it currently stands, with its main terminal, SUN-AIR Technic hangars, accurate marking and signage, custom ground textures, and realistic clutter.  Itâs exclusively available on the MSFS Marketplace for PC and Xbox for $9.99, requiring at least 679 MB of free disk space to install.Shout out to PopFizzels for the news scoop!

    <title>Just Flight Updates FS Traffic for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/jfufst" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/63dd506fd7590b0cbedc19e1_fst1.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="268587"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently issued an update to FS Traffic for Microsoft Flight Simulator, fixing a CTD-inducing compatibility issue, improving the FS Traffic module, and other minor fixes.Â   FS Traffic is Just Flightâs newly released AI traffic plugin that injects traffic based on real-world data with matching models, liveries, and accurate scheduling. It features tens of thousands of real-world flight plans from different periods, sourced from the same supplier used by real-world websites and applications. New flight plans can be added through their Traffic Control Center application, where itâs also possible to add new liveries and third-party AI aircraft models.  The 1.0.2 update fixes a compatibility issue with the FS Traffic in-game menu that would conflict with other third-party in-game panels and lead to a CTD, adds an alternate way to set your destination airport in the Traffic Control Center for VR users, mitigates a crash when changing aircraft and/or livery in the MSFS menu, which would consequently prevent aircraft from generating at the departure and arrival airports, fixes an issue where the FS Traffic module data would not be correctly reset between flights if the user was quick in navigating through various MSFS menus, multiple changes to default settings in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of traffic generating invisible at the departure airport, and the correction of an unhandled exception error in the Traffic Control Center when trying to add a pre-existing route.  Itâs available onÂ Just Flightâs StoreÂ for $39.99, requiring at least 8.6 GB of free disk space to install. Shout out to spkevin81 on our Discord for the news scoop!
