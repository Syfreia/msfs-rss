    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The no-longer constrained UK2000 scenery group have announced that Flagstaff, Arizona will be their next airport destination. The developer began creating scenery outside of their usual scope -- these fair isles -- at the start of the year with John Wayne being released in March. The developer cited both commercial motivations and a boredom with doing very similar UK airports as the main reasons for the change-up. A number of preview screenshots were published of Flagstaff this morning via Facebook, a selection of which are attached throughout this article. Fielding some user questions in the comments section of the same post, the developer confirmed that their next product following KFLG will indeed be a UK airport -- and that Flagstaff will not be coming to X-Plane. UK2000 is exclusively a Microsoft Flight Simulator developer, having suspending X-Plane development at the start of 2021 and similarly for Prepar3D at the end of the year.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. A familiar face with an unfamiliar name will be launching the reincarnation of the Mitsubishi MU-2 for X-Plane this week, with Tom Kyler -- most notably of IXEG -- completely overhauling the now 14 year old product. The product's release will coincide with the gazetting of a new name: X-Scenery is no more and will be replaced with TOGA Simulations to better align with the products the brand makes. The Mitsubishi MU-2 has been a prominent fixture on the X-Aviation store since its creation in 2008. In fact, it was the first product ever sold on the platform according to Cameron Son, the store's owner. Speaking on the X-Pilot forum, Son made the following announcement.  "Today, we're officially announcing Friday, July 15, 2022 as the release date for v2 of this great aircraft! This isn't just an update to the existing aircraft! It's an entirely new code base, 3D model and FMOD sound simulation. It is truly a new product." A specific release time was not given, though the American-based company said they're aiming for 'the afternoon on Friday'. Further information is expected in the coming days. There's been no word of a price yet either. This will be unveiled once the product page goes live later this week. Previous customers of the MU-2 can expect a $20 discount on v2, though these coupons will only be available for 60 days.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Software house SimWorks Studios have come forward today with more information on a large-scale update to their Quest Kodiak 100 aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The details were shared via Facebook, with today's update focusing primarily on the handling characteristics of the aircraft. "Here is an update on the Kodiak packages. A big flight model update was delivered to us this past week, which will improve the response of the aircraft," the team wrote on social media. "Many people complained that the plane was very sensitive to pitch input, something we attributed to the short travel that most desktop yokes have." "After a long time of tweaking and balancing, the next update will improve this aspect of the Kodiak's handling." The new flight model also rectifies the Kodiak's performance, giving a more accurate reflection of the American aircraft after Sim Update 8 left the high-wing somewhat underpowered. The amphibian edition of the Kodiak is also seeing some nice progress according to the developer, even given "MSFS' flight model limitations" in this area. Before release, the aircraft will see some last fine tuning and get a sign off from Quest's parent company Daher. Speaking of a release window, SimWorks have said that both the wheeled Kodiak update and new Amphibian variant should be coming out after Sim Update 10 launches in mid- to late-August. This is to take advantage of new features coming in that update. See the source post for this article on Facebook.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Polish scenery creator MK Studios has launched two new airports today, with both North and South Tenerife Airports (GCXO and GCTS respectively) combined into one scenery package. For previous simulator platforms, such as Prepar3D version 5, the developer opted to sell the airports separately. "Welcome to Tenerife, the largest and most populous island of the Canary Islands," reads the product description. "The island of Tenerife has two airports: the Tenerife North Airport (or Los Rodeos) and Tenerife South Airport (or Reina Sofia). The south airport is situated in a tourist area, and therefore is the busiest, having hundreds of connections to different parts of the world. Tenerife North Airport operates mostly domestic flights between the islands of the archipelago." "In this package, we recreated these two airports, GCTS and GCXO, and added a few POIs with custom satellite images and mesh." The aerodrome pair package includes the following features: You can purchase MK Studios' Tenerife for EUR 15.99 from simMarket or $23.95 AUD (approx. US$16.19 | â¬16,14 | Â£13.68) from OrbxDirect.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. On 22th of July 2022, they announced they had advanced the work on the VC animations, the FMS, and the flight dynamics. As for the external model, they work mainly on the landing gear. There were no other changes on the textures, as other exterior details are still to be finalized. The flight model has also been developed, but it is unknown to what extent. The developers simply say that there is still a lot of work to be done on this aspect. This update primarily adresses the modelling of the FMSÂ and the programming of its various components. As per the update, the developer states that the VCÂ animations 90% complete, although the devs then state that many switches still need to be integrated.Â Readdressing the FMS, the devs strongly emphasize the priority the FMSÂ has in development. Once the FMSÂ is complete, other systems will be worked on and addressed. If you are interested in reading the full update for yourself, you may view it on JustFlight's website. The work is still in progress, and no release date has been announced yet. Threshold will keep you updated on any futher updates.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Bridger Aerospace, a real-life firefighting company, is now using VR simulation to train its pilots to fly in complex conditions, like flying low to put out a forest fire. The simulator they will be using? X-Plane. During real life training, it is impossible to accurately reproduce the conditions of wildfires pilots will be expected to put out. Only simulation and virtual reality can realistically recreate such extreme conditions. On top of this, pilots can even train in the same virtual aircraft using the âshared cockpitâ model from completely different locations - drastically increasing training efficiency and reducing overall cost.  Pretoria Engineering, a real life group of engineers from the University of Astoria, are designing the plug-in for X-Plane 12. When completed, it will integrate Bridgerâs aircraft with the ability to fly ultra realistic aerial firefighting missions. Such an integration of X-Plane into pilot training programs is proof that flight simulation is so much more than a video game - it is capable of not only fulfilling the dream of aviation enthusiasts but also playing a critical role in the training of pilots for an array of possible scenarios they may encounter in real life. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, developer Just Flight published a brief update for its upcoming Fokker F28 Fellowship for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The short blog focused on the work being done on the aircraftâs interior modeling/texturing and cockpit lighting. Announced just over a year ago, Just Flightâs Fokker F28 has seen extensive work being done on it over the past few months. Since the last update, the developers have been making âextensive upgrades to the cockpitâ. Due to the great variations in cockpit design that exist between the F28 variants operated by different airlines, the team chose to base their design on the real F28 they visited in Fokker Technical College. With the layout finalized, the developers are working to improve the visual fidelity of the cockpit while testers, including Â âF28 flight, engineering, and training crewâ, are checking and rechecking every detail. Apart from cockpit modeling, progress has also been made in cockpit lighting. Just Flight has included a few pictures in the update to showcase the night lighting of the Fokkerâs instruments, annunciator, and warning lights. Currently, Just Flight is yet to announce the release date and pricing of the aircraft. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. Shout out to Joe from the official Threshold Discord server for the news scoop. â</summary>
