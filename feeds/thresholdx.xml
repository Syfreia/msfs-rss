    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Windsock Simulations has announced a partnership with FSim Studios which will bring their rendition of Houston's William P. Hobby airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane 12.Â  William P. Hobby Airport (KHOU) is located 7 miles from downtown Houston and is the oldest operating airport in the area. Houston Hobby as it's referred to features 4 runways and acts as a main operating base for Southwest Airlines. The airport sees over 13 million passengers each year and has flights operating to most parts of the United States as well as international service to many Central and South American destinations. Windsock stated in their announcement that the project is still in its early stages but is progressing quickly. They have not announced a release date, yet but have said "we don't expect it to be longâ¦" Threshold is excited to bring you future updates on this and many other projects! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. German flight sim developer Aerosoft is planning to develop an Airbus A321neo alongside the previously announced A330neo for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â  â According to a post on the website of the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Aerosoft has received â¬459,000 from a grant to partially fund their development of the âAirbusNEO seriesâ, which includes the A330neo and A321neo.Â  â â The grant was set up by the German government in 2019 to help boost the games sector within Germany, and to make Germany a hub for game development in Europe. The German government has provided up to â¬50 million each year in grants, and has funded over 400 different video game projects. â Currently, Aerosoft has been hard at work on their highly anticipated A330ceo project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which has come under new management after their previous product manager of more than twenty years, Mathijs Kok, left Aerosoft for the PMDG team. As of the time of writing, Kokâs new position at PMDG has not been revealed to the public yet.As for the A321neo and A330neo, there are a lot of unknowns about their respective projects. The posting on the website says that, âNumerous functions, animations and sound effects are to be developed using state-of-the-art tools that have not yet been implemented in Microsoft Flight Simulatorâ, suggesting that the complexity of these two aircraft will be something unlike their previous work in MSFS. We do not know when an intended release date would be, which aircraft will be released first, or if Aerosoft plans on releasing them as a bundle, as suggested by the post.Â  â At this point in time, much about both aircraft are up to speculation, but what we do know for certain is that they are planned, and they are coming in the near future.Threshold will keep you updated on all the developments regarding the upcoming Aerosoft airliners, so stay tuned! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Matt Wagner was recently Interviewed on 'The Mover and Gonky Show'. This was a two hour long video which included a DCS World Q&amp;A. There are some interesting points made in the video so IÂ encourage you to watch the video aswell.  A Broader Scope:The grand vision is to have a battlefield where ground units can operate seamlessly alongside helicopters and jets. This would mean an immersive experience where users could transition between different theaters of war, each detailed and realistic. â Ground Movement Animation:One of the focal areas for the Eagle Dynamics team currently is the ground movement for infantry. The older animations have stood the test of time but are now due for a refresh. An updated animation is in the works, promising more fluid and realistic movements, in sync with the advancements in game development technology. â New Additions and Updates:While some might be disappointed about the absence of Ukraine and Taiwan maps due to their sensitive nature, the future holds promise: Media Influence:The recent release of Top Gun 2 has spurred an interest in DCS modules. The movie's success resulted in a surge of sales for DCS modules, prompting Eagle Dynamics to release the special 'Be a Maverick' pack, which bundled the F-14, F/A-18, and Supercarrier. â Challenges and Solutions:It's not just about adding new content, but also about refining existing modules: â Potential Future Additions:Questions have arisen regarding the addition of certain aircraft like the SAAB Gripen or the Rafael. The challenge in adding 4+ gen aircraft is the acquisition of necessary resources. However, with partnerships and introductions, nothing is off the table. There's even been talk about the Flanker being introduced as a full-fidelity DCS module, though data acquisition remains a significant hurdle. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has recently announced the development of Uberaba - MÃ¡rio de Almeida Franco Airport (SBUR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Uberaba in Minas Gerais, Brazil, with a yearly average of 104,856 passengers. â The airport was built in the 1930s, with its commercial debut in April 1934: a VASP flight on a Monospar ST4 from SÃ£o Paulo, with a single stop in RibeirÃ£o Preto. During its first decades of operation, it was only an airfield.  â A passenger terminal was only built in 1950, and promotion to airport status only came in 1958 after it was donated from the city to the government (the now defunct Ministry of Aviation).  â Infraero (a state-controlled airport administration company) took control in 1980, investing heavily in modernization and bringing it up to the expected standard of a commercial airport in Brazil: night lighting, a meteorological station, and an eventual terminal expansion many years later in 2008, doubling its passenger handling capabilities. â It was recently purchased by Aena, granting them 30 years of administrative rights over the airport and the obligation of modernizing it within five years of taking control (by 2027, at the very least).  â â The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a detailed terminal interior, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. â Thereâs no release date or price information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. AflOSim has recently released their rendition of Sofia Airport (LBSF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the capital city of Sofia in Bulgaria with a yearly average of 6 million passengers.  The airport was built after a decree from Tsar Boris III in 1937 authorizing the construction on land within the village of Vrazhdebna. It was inaugurated two years later with its first passenger terminal.Â   After a brief period of military exclusivity during World War 2, it was returned to the city in 1947 with a new passenger terminal designed by Ivan Marangozov.Â   In the 1960s, said terminal was already at capacity, with extension work starting in 1968 to counter that issue. From a measly 600,000 passengers in the 60s, the airport was handling around 3 million passengers by the late 1970s.Â   With the numbers constantly growing, they started planning a new expansion in the 1990s, which comprehended the construction of Terminal 2. It was formally opened in 2006, after a 200 million euros investment from the European Investment Bank and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.Â   Terminal 1 serves low-cost carriers such as WizzAir, easyJet, and European Air. Terminal 2 handles the âfancyâ carriers with seven air bridges, 50,000 square meters of total area, 38 check-in desks, and a car park for 820 vehicles.  Aegean Airlines, Air Cairo, Air Serbia, Austrian Airlines, BH Air, British Airways, Bulgaria Air, Corendon Airlines, easyJet, EI AI, European Air Charter, flydubai, GullivAir, ITA Airways, Jet2.com, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Pegasus Airlines, Qatar Airways, Ryanair, Sky Express, SkyUp, Sun Express, Swiss International Air Lines, TAROM, TUI Airways, Turkish Airlines, Windrose Airlines, and WizzAir serve it.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, moving jetways, animated people, custom ground textures, custom night lighting, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.27, requiring at least 621.71 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  Fly2High has recently released their rendition of Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport (LYBE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Serbian city of Belgrade with a yearly average of 5.6 million passengers. â â The airport was built from 1958 to 1962, when it was opened by President Josip Broz Tito, with a passenger terminal occupying 8,000 square meters, a 3,000-meter-long runway, and concrete aprons for sixteen airplanes. It used modern navigational equipment, which granted it the highest international classification according to the ICAO.  â The Yugoslav wars brought stagnation and sanctions, which reduced passenger movement to a minimum, and most of the facilities were decaying and in dire need of repairs. â International traffic only resumed in 2001, followed by a major reconstruction of terminal 2 and runway upgrades in 2005, bringing it up to CATIIIb standards. Its current name was given in 2006 after the famous Serbian-American inventor and scientist.  â Expansion and modernization work started in 2012, reconstructing the A and C gate departure and transit areas, adding an extra 2,750 square meters of built space. Â  Currently, both terminals occupy a total area of 33,000 square meters, with 66 check-in counters and 27 gates (16 with jetways). Terminal 1 is the oldest of the two, recently renovated in 2017. Terminal 2, the largest, was built in 1979 and renovated twice (2006 and 2013), with capacity to deal with 5 million passengers yearly. â  The airport is a hub for Air Serbia and WizzAir, connecting Serbia to the world. The visitorsâ list includes Aegean Airlines, Air Cairo, Air Montenegro, AnadoluJet, Arkia, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, easyJet, Eurowings, flydubai, Hainan Airlines, Jazeera Airways, KLM, Lot Polish Airways, Lufthansa, Luxair, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Nouvelair, Pegasus Airlines, Qatar Airways, Swiss, TAROM, and Turkish Airlines. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom VDGS, hand-made ground textures, dynamic airport lighting, highly detailed models, an official GSX profile, and performance-friendly optimization. â  Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $20.64, requiring at least 9.16 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda has recently announced the development and imminent release of a Cessna 172M for X-Plane 12, part of theirÂ Dynamic Generation SeriesÂ of aircraft, with a strong focus on realism and customizability.  The 172M is a variant of Cessnaâs long-lasting 172 family of aircraft, introduced in 1955 and still under production to this day, with 44,000 units built in total, making it the most popular aircraft in the world. Said variant dates back to 1973, featuring a drooped wing leading edge as its main design difference compared to the previous variants, and the 1974 model had a baggage compartment expansion. Every model year brought a subtle change, with the lettering changing every four years on average (the M variant was manufactured from 1973 to 1976). For example, the L variant from 1971-1972 had changes on the main gear, a dorsal fin extension, and a propeller diameter reduction.Â   The last generation of 172Ms from 1976 marked the end of airspeed registration in miles per hour, switching to knots per the new standard. It was also the last generation to sport the Lycoming O-320-E2D with 150 horsepower, as the 172N had the âinfamousâ O-320-H2AD with 160 horsepower.Â   Thrandaâs rendition features extremely high-resolution textures (1700 pixels per meter) in 8K, a fully configurable 3D instrument panel, VR compatibility, interchangeable yoke styles, over 50 instruments to choose from, liberty to move instruments to any location on the panel, four panel presets, 3D lighting, a dynamic livery editor, full PBR control for livery creators, adjustable wear and tear, windshield ice and rain effects, individual functional circuit breakers, and more.  The complete feature list can be foundÂ hereÂ on their X-Plane.Org Store placeholder (as the product isnât out at the time of writing). The add-on will be available for $29.95 (25% off) and will require 1.4 GB of hard disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RDPresets has recently announced the development and imminent release of Stuttgart Airport (EDDS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Stuttgart in Germany with a yearly average of 7 million passengers. â Built in 1939 to replace BÃ¶blingen Airport, it was taken over by the American forces right after the war. It was partially returned in 1948: runway and facilities were shared with the US Army during the Cold War. â The original terminal was replaced in 2004 with four terminals capable of handling up to 12 million passengers annually.  â Eurowings and Turkish Airlines use Terminal 1; Terminal 2 is used by Lufthansa and Star Alliance partners; Terminal 3 is used by TUIfly and KLM, and Terminal 4 is a separate building for other airlines, set to be rebuilt and expanded in the future. â Itâs a hub for Condor, Eurowings, and TUI fly Deutschland, sporting a substantial list of destinations. â The scenery, set to release on Monday, will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings, a terminal interior, 3d people, and more.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Orbx has released their rendition of London City Airport (EGLC) for X-Plane 12. The company announced on its social media accounts that those who purchased the airport for X-Plane 11 will be able to upgrade to the new version for free.  London City Airport is located in the Royal Docks in the borough of Newham, approximately 6 miles east of London. The airport, which features a single runway, has strict noise abatement procedures due to its proximity to the city. Because of these procedures, the list of aircraft able to operate in and out of EGLC is quite short and features mainly turboprops and regional jets.  Those interested in the new version of EGLC from Orbx can expect to find several new features from the previous version including updated terminal and building models, updated satellite imagery for the airport and surrounding area, and animated vegetation. The new version of the scenery also features custom PBR textures, a detailed interior for the ATC tower, and integration with default roads, railways, and autogen and is available on the Orbx website for $29.99AUD. â Be sure to keep an eye on Threshold to stay up to date in the world of flight simulation!  â</summary>
