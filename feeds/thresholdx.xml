    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Pyreegue Dev Co. has recently released their rendition of East Midlands Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator (EGNX), serving the entire East Midlands region with a yearly average of 3 million passengers.  The airport started as RAF Castle Donington in 1943, sporting three concrete runways and two hangars, and it hosted the 28 Operational Training Unit and the 108 Operational Training Unit during the short WW2 stint. It was closed and decommissioned three years later, in 1946.  Then, in 1964, a group of local government agencies bought the former airfield, investing heavily in transforming it into a commercial airport. It was then renamed East Midlands Airport and got ready for passenger traffic in early 1965.  The airport saw heavy upgrade work in the early 2000s when the traffic figures increased significantly. It included an extension of the passenger terminal, new car parks, and a new pier.  Itâs an important cargo hub for DHL and UPS, which collaborate significantly to its second position in cargo traffic in the UK.  Airline-wise, itâs mostly an LCC airport, with the likes of Jet2.com (Alicante, Antalya, Faro, Fuerteventura, Funchal, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, MÃ¡laga, TenerifeâSouth), TUI (Alicante, Hurghada, Lanzarote, MÃ¡laga, Sharm El Sheikh, TenerifeâSouth), and Ryanair (Alicante, Barcelona, BelfastâInternational, Bergamo, Berlin, Budapest, Cork, Dublin, Faro, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Knock, KrakÃ³w, Lanzarote, Limoges, MÃ¡laga, Malta, Riga, RomeâCiampino, RzeszÃ³w, TenerifeâSouth, WrocÅaw).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with LiDAR elevation data, up-to-date satellite imagery, custom ground polygons with accurate weathering, an up-to-date airport layout, ATC/AI traffic integration, animated Skylink buses, dynamic gate doors (GSX is required), a custom GSX profile, a custom terminal interior, landside buildings, and more.  Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $22, requiring at least 3.56 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SamScene has recently released their rendition of Jeju International Airport (RKPC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in South Korea with a yearly average of 31 million passengers.  The airport was built as a military airfield in 1946 and only converted to civilian use in 1963. The first international flight to Osaka, Japan, only happened a year later.  In the early 90s, due to the constantly rising passenger volume, the government decided to build a much larger terminal, reaching completion in 1997. It has been one of the busiest airports in the country ever since.  Jeju International Airport is a major hub for Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, and it also serves many other airlines, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, EVA Air, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways.  The airport is currently operating at its capacity, so they are constructing a new one near the city of Seogwipo, expected to reach completion by 2025.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed terminal interior, custom night lighting, a detailed city center, iconic points of interest, custom ground markings, custom jetways, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.45, requiring at least 1.33 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. WingSim has recently released their rendition of El AlcaravÃ¡n Airport (SKYP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Yopal, Colombia.  It was built in the 1960s to serve the oil industry in the state, with Aerotaxi Casanare S/A handling most of the passenger traffic.Â   In the late 90s, petrol companies worldwide gathered together to improve the airportâs conditions so it could accommodate larger aircraft. The president landed with a Boeing 707 to inaugurate the improvements in late 1996.  Ten years later, the Camera de Comercio de Casanare (their Chamber of Commerce) asked the Ministry of Transport to make it an international airport, which was only granted many years later. Despite being classified as an international airport and having an immigration facility, it has no international flights.  Itâs currently served by Avianca, EasyFly, Latam Colombia, and Satena, with flights to BogotÃ¡ and Bucaramanga.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom night lighting, a terminal interior, hangars, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.35, requiring at least 2.59 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MSK Productions has recently released their rendition of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (VABB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Mumbai Metropolitan Region with a yearly average of 43 million passengers.  The airport started as a Royal Air Force airfield in the 1930s, housing multiple RAF squadrons during WW2, and was eventually handed over to the government to be converted into a civilian airport once the conflict had ceased.  The first expansion started in the 50s, with further work planned in the 60s but only executed in the late 70s, causing a lot of drama back then. Time magazine said the terminal was a âblack holeâ of sorts, and then a terminal building fire killed three passengers in 1979. It was overcrowded and unsafe.  The new terminal reached completion in 1980, costing 110 million rupees and temporarily solving the overcrowding. It was then modernized in the early 2000s, bringing it up to international standards.  It is currently the second busiest airport in India, after Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. Several airlines serve it, including Air India, IndiGo, Jet Airways, and SpiceJet.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, custom buildings, dynamic lighting, animated jetways, terminal 1 and 2 interiors, custom terraforming, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $22.23, requiring at least 380.25 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Grinelli Designs has recently published a new development update on their upcoming F-100D Super Sabre Module for DCS concerning its current 3D modeling progress, sound design, and future development plans.Â   They have used advanced 3D scanning techniques and photogrammetry to obtain precise measurements, shapes, and textures of the exterior and cockpit, which were then sent to their modeling team to be used as a reference for their work.  Grinelli Designs has also recorded many cockpit sounds to enhance the productâs audio experience.  The current development progress is said to be steadily moving forward, with the airplane in a flyable state and with many advancements in the flight model, engine, fuel, and hydraulic systems, while also actively testing and refining the core systems of the aircraft.  Even though the addition of the 3D scans has improved the accuracy and fidelity of their upcoming product, they claim thereâs more work to be done: continuous refinement of the exterior and interior, flight model tweaks, the implementation of a weapon system, and adding more liveries and customization options. They also claim they have been collaborating with real-world F-100D pilots and experts and actively listening to their insights and knowledge.  They finish the development update with a link to theirÂ progress tracker, where people can see how far they have come with the development so far.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimWorks Studios has published a development update on their upcoming Pilatus PC-12 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator.  The update previews multiple features that will be included with the plane, as well as a tentative release window for the highly anticipated aircraft.  â SWS reports that the executive cabin for the aircraft is now fully functional, with realistic cabin, flood, and reading lights being implemented. All the tray tables, seats, and armrests are also fully modeled and the drawers will close if the aircraft is banked too much. For the exterior, the update details that engine covers that are in addition to the Angle of Attack and pitot vane covers. Along with that, the "Remove Before Flight" tags on the covers will react to external forces such as aircraft slope, through a simulated gravity vector, and react to wind direction and speed.  â The aircraft is around two weeks from completion, and if all goes well, SimWorks Studios plans to send it to Pilatus to verify that that the aircraft's systems and flight model act just like the real aircraft.  â The team says that they are planning a mid-September release, as they are taking a two week break from August 14th through the 25th, and they want to give enough time to fix any bugs that their testing team, or Pilatus might find. As with many projects, this release window is subject to change. Whenever the release date is, Threshold will keep you updated, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <title>MK Studios Releases MontrÃ©al-Trudeau International Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released their rendition of MontrÃ©al-Trudeau International Airport (CYUL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving greater Montreal and eastern Ontario with a yearly average of 16 million passengers.  It opened in 1941, replacing Saint-Hubert Airport - Montrealâs former airport - considered inadequate for the cityâs needs into the 40s and beyond. It was constructed on land that once was a race track, chosen for its size and generally good weather conditions throughout the year. It also doubled as a military airport for almost twenty years.  In the 70s, the government planned on replacing it with a new, much larger airport - Montreal Mirabel -, then the largest in the world, repurposing YUL as a domestic airport. The whole project was centered around traffic growth that never happened for many reasons, which consequently caused the decline of both Montreal airports over the following decades.  The inconvenience of Mirabel grew larger and larger, to the point they decided to resume international operations in Montreal-Trudeau again in 1997 and charter flights in 2004 (and Mirabel ceased passenger operations entirely in 2004).Â   Itâs a hub for Air Canada (Barcelona, BogotÃ¡, Brussels, Calgary, Casablanca, Delhi, Denver, Edmonton, Fort-de-France, Frankfurt, Geneva, Halifax, HoustonâIntercontinental, Lisbon, LondonâHeathrow, Los Angeles, Lyon, Mexico City, Miami, MilanâMalpensa, ParisâCharles de Gaulle, Pointe-Ã -Pitre, Providenciales, RomeâFiumicino, San Francisco, San JosÃ© de Costa RicaâJuan SantamarÃ­a, SÃ£o PauloâGuarulhos, Tampa, TokyoâNarita, TorontoâPearson, Toulouse, Vancouver, Winnipeg), Air Transat (CancÃºn, Cayo Coco, Fort Lauderdale, HolguÃ­n, Lisbon, LondonâGatwick, Lyon, MÃ¡laga, Marseille, Miami, Montego Bay, Orlando, ParisâCharles de Gaulle, Port-au-Prince, Puerto Plata, Puerto Vallarta, Punta Cana, SamanÃ¡, Santa Clara, TorontoâPearson, Varadero), and OWG (Cayo Coco, HolguÃ­n, Santa Clara, Varadero), flying passengers all over the globe.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with LiDAR airport elevation data, custom satellite imagery covering the airport and its surroundings, custom ground polygons, handcrafted 3D models of buildings, jetways, and facilities, realistic night lighting, and more.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $18.70, requiring at least 5.09 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
