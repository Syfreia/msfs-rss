    <title>Just Flight Teases UNS-1 Custom FMS for the 146 Professional</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published aÂ developer updateÂ covering their progress on the UNS-1 Custom FMS for theirÂ 146 Professional, an old style FMS released in 1982 and widely used until the early 2000s, providing GPS navigation with LNAV output to the autopilot and horizontal situation indicator. Users can toggle between the modern FMS, the UNS-1, or no FMS in the Electronic Flight Bag Configuration Menu, without reloading the aircraft.Â   The new UNS-1 will be capable of loading and saving MSFS flight plans, along with full SID/STAR support with transitions and approaches. It also includes advanced features such as real-time fuel monitoring, as long as the user inputs the necessary information (passenger count, cargo, fuel quantity, etc.).Â   Like the real unit, it features VNAV, but it doesnât communicate with the autopilot, making it the user has to manually manage the climbs and descents with IAS and VS, although the built-in VNAV will be able to calculate the top of descent and target vertical speed.  The developer claims it is still under extensive testing, with guidance videos to come once itâs closer to release. Cover picture is courtesy of DragonRuins.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RDPresets has just released their rendition of Bergen Flesland Airport (ENBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second busiest airport in Norway with a yearly average of 6 million passengers. It is an important Scandinavian destination, served by many airlines such as Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, and WiderÃ¸e, with a significant intra-european route network.Â   The origin of the airport dates back to the early 1950s, when a national military communications project secured the construction of a 1460 meter long runway, and 4 million norwegian krone were provided by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana to build a terminal and a road. Additional NATO grants in 1953 warranted a longer runway (2440 meters) and better infrastructure. A DHC-3 Otter was the first aircraft to land on Bergen Flesland, on 18 June 1954, when only 800 meters of the runway were complete. The first revenue chartered flight was a leg to Oslo, transporting SK Brann to play a football match.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom models, PBR texturing, 3D interior, more than a thousand clutter objects on the apron, realistic and functioning VDGS, custom ground textures, performance optimization, accurate night lighting, custom taxi signage, and ground traffic.  Itâs available on theÂ RDPresets StoreÂ for roughly $21.07 or onÂ SimMarketÂ for $19.00, requiring at least 1 GB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlyTampa has recently released their rendition of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for X-Plane 11 and 12, the worldâs third busiest airport in terms of international passenger traffic (as of 2021) and the third busiest in Europe volume-wise, with 70 million passengers yearly.Â   Schiphol is a hub for Corendon Dutch Airlines, KLM, KLM Cargo, KLM Cityhopper, Transavia, TUI fly Netherlands, and Martinair, and a base for easyJet. As previously mentioned, being the third busiest airport in international passenger traffic, the destination network is significant, covering most of the globe. Due to KLMâs extensive International coverage, the intercontinental visitorâs list is not too big, although not tiny either.Â   The airportâs origin dates back to 1916, when it opened as a military airbase for WW1, gradually losing its military role after the war, with plenty of civilian use. By the time it was captured by the Germans in 1940, it already had four runways at 45-degree angles. It wasnât long until the airport was rendered useless by multiple bombings, yet soon rebuilt and crowned the main airport of the Netherlands.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR materials, high-resolution ground textures with custom weather maps, detailed surrounding scenery with numerous custom buildings, tridimensional terrain including tunnels and bridges, surrounding photoscenery, animated apron and local road traffic, dynamic lighting, animated jetways, and VDGS (requires SAM).  Itâs available onÂ FlyTampaâs WebsiteÂ for $28.00, requiring at least 3.78 GB of free disk space to install.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently released a video showcasing the RJ Professionalâs Center Console with its all-new avionics in relation to the 146, demonstrating the functionality of each panel, from the radio stack to the flight deck door controls.  It is their first development update since October, where they stated the airplane was undergoing extensive testing to ensure it was behaving just like the real-life counterpart, and the digital displays were alive with the work on the now showcased center console having just finished. The Inertial Reference System (IRS) and the fully-automatic pressurization controller were pending and yet to be demonstrated.  The Avro RJ is an improved version of the British Aerospace 146, which entered production in 1992. It is the most successful British civil jet airliner program, with 387 units (including the 146). Due to its quiet engines, it was ideal for small city-based airports such as London City. Just Flightâs rendition will include all three variants of the airliner: the RJ70 (26.2m long), the RJ85 (28.6m long), and the RJ100 (31m long), along with 25 brand new liveries covering operators from all over the World. Thereâs no information on the release date or pricing yet.

The airport was built to withstand 200 thousand take-offs and landings yearly, including intercontinental executive jets. With a 2,500m long runway, it can easily take a 738 BBJ, for example.Â   It is the only executive airport in Brazil with authorization to operate flights to New York, London and Paris. It is the sole executive gateway to the country for business fliers.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, modeled and textured with the help of over 3000 photos sent by the airport management, with a performance-friendly approach regarding the interior modeling, bearing brazilian customers in mind. It includes updated satellite imagery, an accurate mesh, and an open hangar. The developer stated plans to update the scenery once the hangars under construction are completed, along with a new taxiway.Â   Itâs available on theÂ GearDown Simulations StoreÂ for $10.01.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has just released their rendition of Bolzano Airport (LIPB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a small regional airport in South Tyrol, Northern Italy. The yearly traffic figures sit at less than 20 thousand passengers, with regional carriers like SkyAlps and Luxwing connecting the city to Berlin, DÃ¼sseldorf, and Hamburg, 7 times a week (as of December 2022).Â   In mid-2016, there was a public poll concerning the future of the airport, because the populace was unhappy with it costing chunks of money every year, with an eventual decision to liquidate the operator company and return the license to the Italian authorities, with potential closure in case of inability to find a new operator. Over 120 million euros were spent without reaching the intended result. Three years ago, the South Tyrol government managed to sell the airport to ABD Holding for 3.8 million euros. The new holders went on to extend the runway to 1,462m in mid-2021.Â   The scenery features realistic HD textures created from on-site photography, an updated layout with the new runway extension, custom static DC-3 and helicopters, main terminal with interior modeling, and a custom ortho.  Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $16.57, requiring at least 2.74 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
