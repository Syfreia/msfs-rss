    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Simmy Aircraft, a newcomer to the X-Plane community, is currently well underway in developing their maiden product, a DA42VI. Having worked and contributed to numerous projects including, LevelUp, Toliss, TFDi, X-Bureau and Magknight, it is evident the team themselves are anything but new. By participating in the production of some of our favorite aircraft, we can be hopeful to see similar qualities in their products. Their early work in progress images show an already stunning strong start, Simmy's has provided Threshold with a fresh set of new images to feature: The team have stated that their primary goal is to provide a product that can be utilized in a manner that aids training. Itâs no secret the DA42 is widely used across the world as a modern twin engine training option, making this a great aircraft to have virtualized, especially considering so many students are actively training on it. With this in mind, the team have expressed that in conjunction to creating a visually immaculate model, the accuracy of flight behaviors and system depth, are at the forefront of their priorities.Â  Looking at the current team of two, it is interesting to note that both members are actively training. With one currently working on his Multi-engine commercial license on the DA42, and the other beginning their flight instructor training. This is a key point, given the fact that both developers know what students want and need from such a simulation, as they both approach this project from the perspective of a student. This in itself gives this team an upper hand, which we hope reflects in the end product.Â  With the aircraft aimed at the upcoming X-Plane 12 platform, this could very well be one of the simulators' very first native payware. Leading the way with a fresh new plane in a fresh new sim. For more information stay tuned, and weâll be sure to bring you the latest when made available.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Phillip from Laminar Research addressed wake turbulence in the upcoming X-Plane 12 Flight Simulator. Involving both player aircraft and AI aircraft and its correlation with the simulator physics and aerodynamics.  AI Traffic After a brief introduction about wake turbulence, Phillip addresses the wake turbulence that is left by AI aircraft. All AI aircraft will leave the correct wake turbulence that corresponds to its aircraft, and is calculated properly with the vortex that is created by the wing of the aircraft. Same will apply for user aircraft. Phillip then goes on to say:  Online Traffic, 3rd Party Plugins, and Live Traffic Further on, Phillip addresses wake turbulence left by online network aircraft, live traffic, and other 3rd party plugins. With the correct data through an ADS-B exchange, X-Plane will calculate the best effects to aircraft weight, wing area, and wingspan through the data the plugin provides. Current XP11 traffic plugins are compatible with the wake turbulence and will be a base function in XP12.  Thatâs it for todayâs update, but Threshold will be sure to keep you up to date with any further X-Plane 12 development updates.</summary>

Thereâs no release date yet, as the foreseeable development is contingent on MSFSâs evolution.Â  LSHâs Release Plan Similar to their Prepar3D release map, Leonardo will most likely divide their Maddog packages by variant. The team will initially release the MD-82 with JT8D-217A engines, a 162Y configured cabin, and a Honeywell FMS to satisfy NAV, VNAV, and ACARS. Following the MD-82 will be an MD-83/88 expansion package, and then JT8D-217C/219 engines, the Canadian Marconi FMS and PMS, an EFB, as well as aging and servicing features.Â Â  Anticipated MSFS Features If youâre strapped for time, a few notable features of the release include: Below is the full feature list thatâll be included in the release version of the MD-80, the list is quite substantial, but not overwhelming.Â  Fly the Maddog X MSFS version 1.0 will include: - MD82 with -217A engines, PAX Cabin 162Y and Honeywell FMS for NAV/VNAV/ACARS; - Flight model and engines performances tested and matched against real aircraft performance tables; - All systems/avionics/tests etc, fully implemented as in the P3D version, including failures/INOPs feature, fully dimmable integral and flood lightning, working TCAS and EGPWS terrain mode; - New FMS Services page for controlling DOORS/STAIR, External power, fuel loading, etc.; - Fully integrated with MSFS ecosystem (jetway, catering, baggage loader, etc...); - Integration with PFPX/SimBrief via Load Manager and retrieval of OFP data via the ACARS system; - Livery manager, and aircraft settings configurable for different aircrafts; - Livery-based cockpit color (pink, blue or gray) and main panel variations (including placards and speed bugs); - Can be installed in the same machine with Fly the Maddog X for P3D; Configurable options from Load Manager:Â  - Panel state when starting simulation (Cold &amp; Dark, Ready at Gate, Ready for Takeoff...); - Weight &amp; Balance and route planner; - Load Manager units (Kg/mbar or Lbs/InHg); Aircraft options: - Cockpit units (Kg/mbar or Lbs/InHg); - PFD flight director style (cross bar or single cue), rising runway, ND wind arrow, groundspeed and aircraft map symbol, HDG UP or TRK UP option; - PFD wired to opposite NAV; - Armed altitude as FL and AutoArm altitude option; - Gear waring inhibit above 1500ft AGL; - Always play aural when autopilot disconnects; - Auto brake system; - Three VOR instrument versions: VOR/ADF/DME, VOR/ADF and VOR only; - Two altimeter versions: DUAL/SINGLE knob; - Optional TAS/SAT indicator; - Flat or Cone tail; Simulator options: - Enable failures; - Autopilot disconnect when flight controls moved; - Automatic update of aircraft weight and cg; - Automatic fuel loading; - Enable PM calls; - Sync CM1/CM2; - FSUIPC compatibility mode; - Maximum luminosity of all cockpit lights and instruments (flood, integral, LED, LCD and CRT); - Failures probability, separated for LIGHT, MEDIUM and DANGEROUS; - INOP systems according to MEL; Some Sidenotes Stefan informed the community that the Maddog will contain modifiable settings (including panel states) actively within the sim without requiring a flight restart. Another detail mentioned in the footnotes is the lack of weather radar functionality due to the SDKâs current state, but will be implemented, for free, as soon as the SDK will allow.Â  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As the war in Ukraine endures, Threshold is allocating all of the donation proceeds, including previous Threshold donations, towards the Ukrainian Crisis cause. 25% of all proceeds is set aside for Ukrainian X-Plane developers while the remaining is directly sent to UNICEFâs donation program for Ukrainian children.

    <title>Aerosoft Updates Mykonos Airport Scenery </title>
    <updated>2022-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently released an update for their Mykonos airport scenery. The update is quite lengthy and substantial with numerous changes made to keep the airport's virtual rendition up to date with the real airport. Let's take a closer look and highlight some of the more interesting additions made.Â  Before we get into the particulars. Looking at the images above we can really begin to appreciate how far scenery development has come, with the developers putting effort into seamlessly blending the airport into an already realistic default scenery. The releases of yesteryears in flight simulation would frequently have contrasting colours between the scenery satellite imagery and the default textures. The majority of changes have been prompted by the recent changes Mykonos airport has undergone. The $28 million upgrade has essentially given the airport a âfaceliftâ with a stunning new facade symbolizing the traditional Cycladic architecture. The project was set to open in 2021 and so it did, with no delay from Aerosoft who were relatively quick to follow suit and update their product. Hereâs their full change list for you to check out: Reading through the list, it seems the team at Aerosoft has almost completely recreated the airport, with new lights, new textures, new modeling and enhanced mesh, with existing users being able to expect an almost brand new product. It is pleasing to see this focus on what essentially can be referred to as virtual modernisation, especially as an update and not as a whole new product. While not expected from developers, scenarios like these are appreciated. Check out their official post on the update, and should you wish to purchase the product, it can be found on the Aerosoft store.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Recently, a new banner has quietly appeared on Just Flightâs website, announcing that the much anticipated Concorde for Microsoft Flight Simulator will be releasing sometime this month (March 2022). The aircraft, developed by DC Designs, is built ground up for the new simulator with customized handling models and accurate modeling/texturing, bringing users an enjoyable flying experience with the worldâs only supersonic airliner. Over the past few months, DC Designs has released weekly updates on the development progress of the Concorde. The latest one, posted on February 25th, teases that work is currently being done on PBR textures and showcases the external and internal modeling of the aircraft. It is clear from both the text and the pictures that Concord is near completion. 	Announced in mid 2021, DC Designâs Concorde âis designed to be both an accessible and yet highly detailed rendition of this iconic aircraftâ. To ensure a high degree of accuracy with its designs, the team has reconstructed the aircraft with hundreds of real life images of the Concord taken from museums and exhibits. Checkout Just Flightâs website for a complete list of the Concordeâs features. Currently, neither Just Flight or DC Designs has published an official announcement that specifies the release date and pricing for the Concorde. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. </summary>

    <title>Just Flight Further Previews MSFS BAe 146</title>
    <updated>2022-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has posted more previews of their upcoming BAe 146 for MSFS2020. The news comes in light of their subsequent aircraft developments, such as the newly announced 757, collaboration with DCDesigns, and In-House Fokker F28. The team mentions in their Facebook post that more news will be delivered in the imminent future and that "release time draws closer." The following screenshots showcase the aircraft partaking in a test flight from Southampton to Bournemouth.  For those who are unaware, the British Aerospace 146, also known as the BAe 146, is a short-haul regional airliner developed by British Aerospace. Containing four turbofan engines, as well as a T-tail, the "Jumbolino" garners its reputation from its quirky design features. Over 380 units were built from 1978-to 2001, primarily serving European operators such as CityJet and Swiss. The aircraft was delivered under the name "Avro RJ" after 1992, shipping with upgraded avionics and more powerful engines. In the current world, few Avro RJs remain, some serve middle eastern carriers, and some serve as "off the grid" transporters as the aircraft contains gravel landing abilities.  Just Flight did not share any additional information regarding the BAe 146's development, but keep an eye out shortly as the team admitted that there's a new development update around the corner.</summary>
