    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Lunar Simulations hasÂ recently announcedÂ the development of a freeware Boeing 767 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, set to feature integration with the Salty Simulations mod for proper autopilot behavior, a fully custom primary flight display, an EFB, cockpit animations, and more.Â   According to the developer (on the announcement post), the development started in October 2021 (1 year and three months ago), with its current progress at a state where they can finally show some of it in the form of screenshots. The feature list includes realistic flight dynamics, a high-quality 3D cockpit and exterior, realistic systems and avionics, accurate performance data, high-resolution textures, and custom sounds and effects (marked as coming soon).Â   The Boeing 767 is a mid-size, wide-body twin-aisle airliner that first entered service in 1982, designed as a technology bridge between the narrow-body 757 and the wide-body 747/777, seating from 181 to 375 passengers and with a range of 3,850nm to 6,385nm depending on the variant. It has been a popular choice for years due to its fuel efficiency and operational flexibility, suiting domestic (North America) and long-haul operations. Over 1000 767s have been built in total as of 2021.  Thereâs no information regarding the release date yet, but Threshold will keep you updated! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently released FS Traffic for Microsoft Flight Simulator, their brand-new AI traffic plugin that injects traffic based on real-world data with matching models, liveries, and accurate scheduling.Â   FS Traffic features a fleet of native aircraft models with performance in mind, sporting high-definition textures, night lighting, custom animations, custom visual effects, compatibility with airport jetways and ground units, realistic sounds by Turbine Sounds Studios, and compatibility with online networks such as VATSIM, along with tens of thousands of real-life commercial flight plans from different periods, with data sourced from the same supplier used by real-world websites and applications.Â   Data coverage includes the summer of 2022, with 2021 and 2019 to follow as free updates in the future. The time and the day of the week you choose within the simulator will dictate the density, as it is in real life.  Users can customize their flight plans withÂ Traffic Control Centre, a tool where you can create new flight plans, add liveries, and add new third-party aircraft (as AI). Traffic density can be controlled on the fly with the in-game menu, with the possibility to regenerate it or get rid of it altogether.Â   The developers claim there is no performance impact compared to the default offline traffic because models are said to be optimized, taking full advantage of the simâs visuals without tanking the framerate.Â   Itâs available onÂ Just Flightâs StoreÂ for $39.99, requiring at least 8.6 GB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently released an update (v3.00.0060) to their 737 Lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator, adding MMRs (multi-mode radios), minor fixes, and changes to the ground handling behavior.Â   In theÂ update announcement post, Robert Randazzo states the update is mostly âfoundationalâ with most of it being stripped out of the changelog due to it being internal and focusing on âpreparing the groundâ for future equipment additions such as the upcoming EFB.  The highlights include the addition of Multi-Mode Radios and the tweaks to the ground handling qualities of the airplane, switching from PMDGâs own internal algorithms to Asoboâs, claimed to be better than before and with the promise of further tweaks to bring a realistic Boeing steering experience. The complete changelog follows down below:  0012223: [Pedestal - Radios/Comms/Navs]introduction of MMRs (GLS functionality pending) (abashkatov) 0012251: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Black texture on all VC's (vscimone) 0012210: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Captain Footrest adjustment (vscimone) 0012253: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Texture clipping on NAV 2 panel (vscimone) 0012228: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Comm 2 strange texture (abashkatov) 0012173: [Virtual Cockpit - Functionality/Click-Spots] F/O PREV PAGE button not animating (vscimone) 0012211: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Right Air outlet needs adjustment (vscimone) 0012198: [External Model - Geometry] Light bleeding through front cabin walls (jbrown) 0012199: [External Model - Geometry] Hole in front of passenger cabin (jbrown) 0012150: [FMS - Performance Pages] Consistent use of custom payload ZFW value (emvaos) 0012190: [General - Ground Operations] Stairs 1L Arrive Even if JTWY INH (hvanrensburg) 0012175: [FMS - Setup/Options Pages] EFIS/MAP Options still greyed out (hvanrensburg) 0012180: [External Model - Liveries] Texture Alignment Between Fuse2 - Fuse3 Left Side (jbrown) 0012176: [Virtual Cockpit - Geometry/Textures] Black texture on top of glareshield (vscimone) 0012226: [Virtual Cockpit - Functionality/Click-Spots] Switches with PMDG Mouse option (hvanrensburg)â â The 737-900 variant is out of the testing phase, undergoing work on the last-minute details for the impending release.Â   The Universal Flight Tablet is still being worked on, with a WASM/communication issue depending on input from Asobo to find out whether itâs on their end or a platform problem.  The upcoming DC-6 update is waiting on a platform update before it can be released, and the 777 is still being worked on but with nothing to show for the time being.  The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Pictures are courtesy of Pineapple_Wizard.

    <title>Orbx Releases Helipads LA Police for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/orbhel" rel="alternate"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/63d3ac5bb7fdb4be0e3b9899_lapd1.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="814224"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released a set of LAPD helipads in downtown Los Angeles for Microsoft Flight Simulator, part of their Police Activities Expansion Pack aimed at city-building simulation professionals.Â   The pack features a highly detailed model of the LAPD Heliport, the LAPD headquarters, the LA County Jail, and many Sheriffâs department helipads scattered around the LA basin area. Itâs said to offer a unique and realistic look into the daily operations of the police forces in a Major urban area.  TheÂ Los Angeles Police Department heliportÂ is a helicopter landing facility in Los Angeles, established in the 1970s as a way for the LAPD to have quick access to the cityâs airspace for various policing needs, such as the pursuit of suspects and surveillance. The heliport is also used for training and administrative purposes. Over the years, the LAPD has acquired a fleet of helicopters for use at the heliport, Â including the Bell 206 JetRanger, the Airbus H125, and the Airbus AS350. The heliport has become an important part of the LAPDâs policing efforts and is considered one of the busiest law enforcement heliports in the United States.  TheÂ new Los Angeles Police Department headquartersÂ is a state-of-the-art facility located in downtown Los Angeles, California. The building was conceived to be environmentally friendly and sustainable, featuring energy-efficient systems and materials. The new headquarters will be a 12-story building with approximately 602,000 square feet, comporting around 1,200 employees, including offices, training rooms, a fitness center, a secure parking structure, and a rooftop terrace. It replaces the old Parker Center, demolished in 2018.  TheÂ Los Angeles County JailÂ is a complex of several facilities located in LA. Itâs the largest jail system in the United States, with an average daily population of around 18,000 inmates. It's operated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and is responsible for the incarceration of individuals who have been arrested or awaiting trial. The jail facilities range from maximum to minimum security and include the Menâs Central Jail, the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, and the Inmate Reception Center. The jail system has been the subject of criticism in the past for issues such as overcrowding, inadequate medical care, and mistreatment of inmates. In recent years, the Department has implemented several reforms addressing these issues, including reducing the jail population, improving conditions for inmates, and increasing transparency and accountability.  Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $10.18, requiring at least 1.71 GB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda Design has recently released their rendition of the Cessna C337 Skymaster for X-Plane 11 and 12, part of theirÂ Dynamic Generation SeriesÂ aircraft. It is a unique light aircraft produced by Cessna Aircraft Company, known for its distinct design, featuring a twin-boom tail configuration and a rear pusher propeller, and a tractor propeller in the front. It was first introduced in 1963 and produced until 1982. The Skymaster was available in piston and turboprop versions, with the latter having a longer range and higher cruising speed. The aircraft also features retractable landing gear, making it versatile for land and water operations. It is a highly sought-after aircraft by enthusiasts and collectors, due to its design and historical significance.  Thrandaâs C337 features a fully configurable 3D instrument panel, VR compatibility, interchangeable yoke styles, over 50 instruments to choose from (movable), four panel presets (customizable), full 3D lighting, savable presets, dynamic livery editor, high-resolution PBR materials, a fully modeled Continental IO-320-F front engine, windshield ice and rain effects, and individual functional circuit breakers.Â   The fly-out menu offers a variety of features for a realistic and customizable flying experience. It includes controls for electric tug, chocks, tie-downs, covers, lights, and the option to enable or disable a Cargo Pod with realistic weight and drag characteristics. Users can also choose to start in a "cold-and-dark" state for realistic startup procedures. The menu also allows for control over landing lights, strobes, beacon, and navigation lights, as well as a detailed weight and balance manager with a visual chart and the ability to save and load configurations. Additionally, users can hide or show individual seats to create a hybrid passenger/cargo version, adjust the field of view, control audio channels in real-time, move the plane around the world with slew control, fine-tune instrument positions, swap pilot and co-pilot seats, and select different yoke styles.Â   This aircraft boasts detailed and accurate flight dynamics and weight and balance, developed with the help of multiple real-world active Stationair pilots, ensuring a proper "feel" and accurate performance during takeoff, climb, cruise, and landing. The C337 is a twin airplane where the props spin in opposite directions, canceling out torque on the airframe. In the event of a single engine failure, the flight behavior is not greatly affected as the engines are in line and do not produce a net yaw force on the plane. Additionally, tie-downs and chocks are included to keep the plane from moving in high winds. The aircraft also features DynaFeel, which simulates the strength of the control surfaces affected by oncoming air, and how much would be necessary to overcome these forces.  The aircraft features high-fidelity, multi-track sounds with smooth transitions, calculated to minimize "muddy" sounds by using the precise beat frequency for each section. It also includes atmospheric effects, allowing the user to adjust the volume of different aspects of the sound experience in real time. The sounds are divided, with different sonic characteristics for the front and back engine, and panning around the plane in exterior view yields 3D audio effects such as a "blade slapping" sound when viewed perpendicular to the prop. Far-away sounds include aerodynamic interaction effects between the front and rear propeller, and the cockpit buttons and switches each have their own unique sound. The engine also has a cool-down ticking sound based on temperature. The sounds also give clues about what's happening under the hood, and the outside wind intensity is affected by slip and AoA, making the sound louder when the surface area of the fuselage is hit by oncoming wind. Opening doors and windows also lets in outside sounds.  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $39.95, requiring at least 1.4 GB of free disk space to install.
