    <title>M'M Simulations Releases TromsÃ¸ Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. M'M Simulations have released their visual rendition of TromsÃ¸ Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Touching down in the Scandinavia region, the team has brought their skills to the airport and its surrounding area. Being established in the 1930s, the airport was first operated by Norwegian Air. As the European Theater of WW2 began, the airport began servicing the Junkers Ju-52 for the German Luftwaffe and they began the expansion of the aerodrome. After the war, the Norwegian Air Force took over operations and began adding expansions to the airport. Years later, the Norwegian Parliament approved construction for public passenger services, with the airport opening to the public on the 14th of September, 1964. The team has included a small, but down to the point feature list. Starting, the team has accurately modeled the surrounding area and the airport grounds, alongside accurate terraforming and CGLÂ data. PBRÂ textures have been added, and a modeled interior for added user experience. Ambient animated objects and an upcoming terminal have been all included.  If you are interested in picking this scenery package up for yourself, you can find it over on the simMarket Store and sells for â¬19.00. If you are interested in any other renditions by the team, you can view their catalog on their website.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has returned with another major airport, soon to be released for Microsoft Flight Simulator, hopping over to Brussels with a detailed rendition of the namesake airport, the team has released a trailer for the product, signalling a close-to-release stage of the development. The project has been through an extended development period since the earlier days of MSFS, and the recent developments and news on the forums has portrayed a project status that's closer to the end of the tunnel. In typical Aerosoft fashion, their development house has brought a vividly detailed recreation of the airport, featuring a well-rounded replica of the terminal complex and its interior. It will also boast some unique features such as assisted docking. It has not been confirmed that the system will work for all aircraft types, but further details regarding the feature may be confirmed as we approach the release of the airport. Brussels Airport, which has the ICAO code EBBR, served almost twenty-five million passengers in Europe in 2019 making it Europeâs 24th busiest airport. The main airline to serve the airportis the countryâs flag carrier, Brussels Airlines, which operates an all Airbus fleet including the A319, A320, and A330.

    <title>PMDG On Approach to Release for 737-700; Remains Tight-Lipped On Release Date</title>
    <updated>2022-04-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG is reaching the end of the tunnel in the development of their hotly-awaited 737-700NG3. On their forums, Robert Randazzo detailed that the team remains bullish for a timely release, but is still reserved on setting a concrete release date due to several factors adding âambiguityâ to the projectâs completion, and the upcoming Sim Update 9 from Asobo additionally brings more uncertainty to the add-onâs stability with potential issues that is unforeseeable. Randazzo explained that a lot of logistics are involved in preparation for enabling the team to adapt to SU9, one of which is ensuring a stable testing environment to avoid a ânegative initial user experienceâ. A lot of details are yet to be finalised, including the release date which not even the team has a concrete answer internally, there is an âentire evaluative processâ taking place to pinpoint a date. That said, RSR reassured that the productâs launch will not be a surprise drop in store, a release date with possibly an approximate time of day will be announced prior to the release. As the team approaches the final leg of the 737-700âs development, Randazzo optimistically said that things will become much more exciting between now and the productâs release. The embargo will be lifted so testers of the add-on can share and provide additional new insights into the product, streamers who got ahold of the aircraft will have their embargo lifted as the plane is released.Â  To kickstart the beginning of the hype building, the team is currently releasing a series of walkthrough videos on the 737-700 on their YouTube channel, with an introductory video published already (embedded on top). A few hours ago, another video is published detailing the Tow Out and plans after the release of the aircraft: More videos will steadily be published in the coming days and weeks. Moving on, Randazzo has shifted to discussing the sounds that are developed for the add-on. Armen, who is principally behind the soundset, has been developing a âsound-scapeâ to match the visuals and systems fidelity of the rest of the aircraft. Stressing that the sound engine that MSFS used is âunlike anything they have every[sic] had the opportunity to work withâ, to which Armen has used the engine to its full potential. Randazzo wraps up the update by assuring that this will be a monumental release, both for the team and the flight sim community; the talent behind Vin and Jason to develop the most visually, and technically faithful 737 for MSFS combined with the delightful sonic experience from Armen that brings the bird to life.

    <title>PMDG Outlines Early Adopter Model for MSFS 737</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, PMDG published a lengthy blog, detailing its plans for the release of its much anticipated 737NG series for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Through the blog, the developers explained in detail the Early Adopter model they will utilize for their upcoming products and outlined a general release plan for its 737s. According to PMDG, the Early Adopter model will be implemented for the first time to give the developers additional time to fully master the new technologies brought by MSFS, allowing them to gradually implement features that they couldnât provide in the past. In the Early Adopter Period that starts with the initial release of the -700, ânew features, bug fixes, model and texture improvements, performance optimizations, and increasing MSFS integration will be rolled out in update intervals spaced approximately two weeks apartâ. During this time, the -600, -800, and -900 will also be released, with new updates being made available to all four variants simultaneously. In total, the developers expect this period to run a total of 24 weeks, ending around 6 weeks after the release of the -900, though it may be extended if needed. The developers stressed that the airplanes will be fully functional during this time and this period will enable them to âexpand it beyond the initial capabilities deliveredâ. Additionally, PMDG will be providing a list of features that it will add/optimize, including ones that are currently unachievable due to SDK limitations. The list will be kept up-to-date with the roll out of each new version.Â  After the Early Adopter Phase, the aircraft will enter the continued maintenance phase where PMDG will shift focus away from developing new features and instead provide regular compatibility/stability updates, turning to the development of its next product - the 777 series for MSFS. Currently, PMDG has not yet announced a firm release date or pricing for the 737NG series. However the developers stressed that the Early Adopter phase will not affect the price of the aircraft. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research has taken to their Twitter page to showcase previews of X-Codr Designs Denver 2.0 in X-Plane 12, an upcoming free update to the popular airport. The developerâs version two rendition of Denver is set to release with a multitude of exciting changes, these include the new terminal expansions, improved ground textures, revamped terminals, and more. You can view the full feature list below. It was also confirmed by the developer that they still plan on supporting X-Plane 11. As well according to X-Codr, they donât believe that the X-Plane 12 version of the airport will require a separate download, as the X-Plane 11 version should ignore the X-Plane 12 features. Due to the strict NDA still in place for Laminarâs new simulator, the developer has stated that they wonât be making an official announcement on the forums until X-Plane 12 releases. As well, X-Codr Designs has assured users that progress on Sedona is still developing nicely, and will not be affected by Denver. It was also said that work has finished on the rocks, and the airport will be started, with previews coming soon. In the meantime, you can purchase Denver for X-Plane 11 via the X-Plane.org store for $29.95. As well, make sure to check out the source post for this article via the developerâs website, and join their discord for further information.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Earlier this week, scenery developer Aviotek Simulation Software has published a short update on its upcoming Frankfurt Airport scenery for both X-Plane 11 and MSFS. The brief blog provides the community with a glimpse into the sceneryâs progress and showcases new previews. According to the developers, they are trying to âintegrate and include as many details as possible, as well as some unique features never seen beforeâ, a process that will âtake way longer than expected sometimesâ. Therefore, at the current stage, it is impossible to estimate how much longer the team needs to complete the airport. From the previews accompanying the post, it is clear that the modeling for the passenger and cargo terminals, towers, and hangers are mostly complete. A few ground vehicles ranging from buses to pushback trucks are also showcased. In a previous post, the developers has revealed that the scenery will come with high quality PBR textures and custom animations for both simulators, promising to provide in-sim previews as soon as possible. Currently, the developers are yet to announce a release date or pricing for Frankfurt Airport. Based on Aviotekâs previous products, the scenery will likely cost between $18 and $26 USD. Threshold will keep you updated on this front. â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Scenery developer Verticalsim has released the highly anticipated Myrtle Beach (KYMR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. This scenery is not just the airport of the South Carolina city but it comes with the surrounding hotels too. Being used as an army base until 1948, the city of Myrtle Beach decided there was not a need for an airport in the area, though funds were allocated. With the land being annexed in 1977, the property was used as a join civil-military airport, though it severely limited the number of civilian flights. Years later in 1996, the airport gained international status with new terminals with an influence from the local beaches. The airport served over 2.4 million passengers in 2018, being the second busiest airport in South Carolina. The product comes with many features that portray the quality work of Verticalsim. Starting off, the 2022 layout of the airport is included along with proper taxi signage. Custom jetways compatible with the SAM plugin are also a part of this package. Some hotels outside the airport grounds have been modeled to add extra depth to the surrounding area.Â  If you are interested in picking this visual rendition of Myrtle Beach for yourself, you can find over on the simMarket store, and sells for $13.87. If you are interested in other various scenery packages developed my Verticalsim, you can check out their website to view the assortment of sceneries for XP11 and MSFS.</summary>
