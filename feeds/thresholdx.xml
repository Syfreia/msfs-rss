    <summary>Sim: MSFS. The highly anticipated Just Flight Vulcan project is now available for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It is the most accurate and detailed recreation of the Avro Vulcan for any Flight Simulation. The Just Flight team has put tremendous effort and resources into the project, gathering hours of data, sounds, and details from the latest surviving airframe. Thanks to the Maintenance and Preservation Society, the Just Flight team gained access to detailed sound recordings, resulting in two engine types of sound sets â the Olympus 200 Series and the Olympus 301 Series engines.  Vulcan's interior is modeled to exact details based on XM655 sampled for this recreation. The cockpit, with hundreds of functional switches, knobs, and controls, is also modeled to perfection. Lighting includes over 25 functioning lighting controls, bringing the ambiance of the real aircraft at night to the simulator. The rear crew panels are also modeled in outstanding detail, as well as the texturing and modeling, which is as close to the real aircraft as possible, with 8k PBR texturing bringing out all of the details from the inside out. The package includes various liveries (19) fitting the time of the Vulcan's service history. The aircraft simulation includes realistic payloads like Blue Steel, 1000-pound bombs, and bomb bay tanks. The bomb bay doors function and are fully animated, along with other animated features such as lift dumpers and the tail-mounted air brake. Further simulations cover the complex electrical, fuel, and engine management systems and CAN and VOR NAV radio systems. Vulcan's flight model has undergone extensive work to bring realistic and accurate flight characteristics to the sim.  Feedback from former Vulcan crewmembers was used to create the most accurate flight model for the sim. Custom effects like compressor exhaust haze, exhaust, and the Houchin GPU bring in the immersive level expected for this historic aircraft. These systems are coded based on real-world manuals. The operations and EFB manuals can be downloaded from the links below. The Vulcan sales for 32.99 on Just Flights website.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BMWorld and AmSim have recently released their rendition of Arlington Municipal Airport (KGKY) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Arlington, Texas, with a yearly average of 151,000 passengers (as of 2006).  Itâs a reliever airport for DFW and DAL and housing companies such as the Bell Helicopter division of Textron.Â   Unlike most US airports, KGKY doesnât have an IATA code.  97% of the airportâs yearly operations consist of general aviation traffic, with only 3% corresponding to air taxi.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a fully modeled terminal building, custom ground markings, high-resolution ground textures, custom night lighting, and animated people.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $9.53 and requires at least 1.10 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to Cristian Ionescu for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cockspur has recently published a new video on Facebook and Discord, showcasing what appears to be an almost finished Embraer Phenom 100. Cockspur is renowned for its Cessna Mustang and its latest Cessna 162. The one-and-a-half-minute video provides a quick look at the intricate details that Cockspur is known forâthe avionics in the video feature the GARMIN 1000, similar to those present in the real aircraft. The video also showcases the exterior details, which look intricate based on the close-up shots. The cabin is fully modeled, as expected. Although the developer has yet to release much information regarding specific features, we can expect to receive more details on this project soon. The Embraer Phenom 100 is a part of the Phenom corporate jet brand, manufactured by Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer. The Phenom 100, the smallest model in the range, is classified as a VLJ (Very Light Jet), with the larger model being the 300E. Phenom 100's first flight took place on July 26, 2008, and since then, it has brought Embraer immense success with the Phenom brand. A new configuration of the Phenom will cost you around $3 million. With over 400 built, it is one of the most popular light jets in the market. The Phenom is powered by two Prat and Whitney turbofan engines, producing 1,750lbs of thrust each. This engine configuration gives the Phenom 100 the ability to cruise at 400 knots with a maximum altitude of 14,100 feet with a range of about 1,300 NM. The Phenom has a single pilot rating thanks to many of its automated features. With its Prodigy Touch flight deck and Garmin 1000, these systems are highly streamlined to reduce pilot workload. The Phenom's BMW-designed cabin can comfortably carry up to five passengers.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Coming shortly after their recently released Avro Vulcan, Just Flight has posted an update on their website regarding their upcoming Fokker F100 and F70. The development update mainly highlights the door and cabin configurations available for the aircraft at launch. The Fokker F100 and F70 were developed from the earlier F28. Both airframes offer a larger cabin and payload than the F28 and updated avionics. The F100/F70 features 2 Rolls-Royce Tay Mk 650-15 or Mk 620-15 Turbofan engines. The larger of the two engine options has a thrust output of 67 kN which allows the F100 to cruise at Mach 0.77 for a maximum range of over 1700nm. The upcoming F100/F70 will include 4 different door options as well as an interior that is customizable through the included paint kit. Just Flight also teased a fan favourite feature from the F28 that will be making another appearance, and that is the music reproducer panel that allows users to use custom boarding music for the enjoyment of their virtual passengers. The update goes on to state that moving forward they will be working on fine-tuning the artwork of the aircraft as well as improving other things such as cabin lighting.
