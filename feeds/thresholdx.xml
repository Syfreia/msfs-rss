    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The flight simulation community has seen the emergence of a new developer group, CreatorOfWorldS (COWS). The team has generated significant interest with their first product in production, the Diamond DA42 aircraft, a highly detailed and accurate replica of the aircraft. Early previews of the product have generated excitement among enthusiasts and professionals alike when shared on social media. Their first public appearance was under another name. We covered the quartet of developers "Simmy Aircraft" for their first debut in an earlier article. COWS has stated that their primary goal is to provide products that will aid in training and simulation opportunities for students and consumers. They have put a lot of effort into replicating the flight behaviour and systems through real aircraft testing and feedback. The development team comprises four members, one of which is Mitchell, who is in charge of creating the meticulously crafted 3D model of the plane. He had direct access to a DA42 throughout the development process, which means that everything about the model has been created based on manuals, pictures, first-hand experience, and a lot of passion for the project. Another team member, Jacob, is responsible for everything under the hood. He has carefully recreated the flight model, electrics, fuel, engine control units, and de-ice system based on the aircraft's manuals and first-hand experience flying the real-life counterparts. The flight model has been tuned to match performance tables accurately, and the result is so close to the real plane that it can be handled just as it would in the real world. Boris is in charge of creating the sounds for the aircraft. He is known for his work in the flight simulation community, being in charge of audio at FlyByWire, the FlightFX Vision Jet and having created sound packs for the Cirrus SR-22 in Microsoft Flight Simulator. To create realistic sounds for the COWS' DA42, Boris has recorded real aircraft sounds and incorporated them into the simulator to ensure a truly immersive user experience. With Peter at the helms of reason, administrative tasks, branding and 3D work assistance, the four members sum up the current team. The COWS DA42 is equipped with a fully custom Garmin G1000NXi avionics system. This system has been created using a combination of manuals, first-hand experience, and Garmin software in order to make it as accurate as possible to the real-world version of the system. The system includes simulation of many of the features of the real Garmin, such as the GPS satellite constellation, profile saving and copying, persistent settings, and system statuses. The system also includes simulations of other systems, such as the PFD, AHRS, ADC, GTX335R, and GMU. Currently, the only features that remain to be added to the simulation are custom flight planning with custom LNAV/VNAV and maps. The system also has the capability to remember user settings. It allows for per-livery, and per-aircraft configurations, giving users the ability to customise their avionics package to their preferences.  The video is a demonstration of the fully custom G1000NXi from COWS own press release. â â The development is still ongoing, and the team is working hard to bring the DA42s to the flight simulation community. No timeline is given, but they are dedicated to ensuring no stone is left unturned and bringing the best DA42s they can offer their users. However, as the team put it, it will take them a little more time to finish everything and ensure everything is perfect. In their press release, COWS mention that their next project will be the DA40-180 XLS, after their DA42 series.  To follow their progress, you can join their discord.  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published theÂ first development updateÂ on the Fokker 70 &amp; Â 100 project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, announced last year. Itâs composed of some information on the current state of things and fourteen screenshots.Â   Their Fokker 100âs cockpit, exterior models, and textures are undergoing extensive testing, with dynamic lighting in the cockpit and externally being the latest addition. Work is yet to begin on the 70 variant and a detailed passenger cabin for both. Just Flight plans to keep everyone updated with further development updates.Â   The product will feature (once finished) native models with 4K and 8K textures, realistic animations including dynamic wing-flex, all doors (including cargo), lift-dumpers, and the tail-mounted airbrake. The cockpit will feature hundreds of functional switches, knobs, controls, and high-resolution displays, driven by complex custom-coded systems based on real-world FCOMs, including hydraulic, electrical, fuel, pressurization, and a custom navigation system with an FMS.Â   The Fokker 70 &amp; 100 are twin-turbofan regional aircraft, developed by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker. The Fokker 70 is a shorter version of the 100, seating up to 86 passengers. The F100 variant can fit up to 110 passengers. They were introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, rapidly gaining popularity among regional airlines due to their cost-effectiveness and reliability. However, due to financial difficulties, Fokker went bankrupt in 1996, with a permanent halting of the production line. Despite it all, there are many F70s and F100s around to this day, especially in Australia.  Thereâs no information regarding the price or release date yet. Stay tuned to Threshold for more information on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Airworthy Designs has recently released their rendition of Saint BarthÃ©lemy Airport (TFFJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the third most dangerous airport in the world according to The History Channelâs Most Extreme Airports documentary, only behind Toncontin and Lukla.Â   With a 646-meter-long runway, itâs only served by small regional aircraft and charters, with the Dash 7 being the largest aircraft ever allowed to operate at St. Barths. It sees a steady average of 190 thousand passengers per year, on all sorts of small planes such as the Pilatus PC-12, the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, the DHC-6 Twin Otter, and the BN-2 Islander.Â   Itâs a hub for Tradewind Aviation, with flights to Antigua, St. Thomas, and San Juan. The visitorsâ list includes Air Antilles, West Indies Helicopters, and Winair, taking people to St. Maarten, Pointe-Ã -Pitre, and Saba.Â   Cargo-wise, DHL Aviation offers a wide range of destinations between the nearby islands.Â  The scenery was developed with on-site photography, input from residents, and attention to detail to provide a very authentic experience. It features the whole island, with most of its points of interest like the Port of Gustavia, the industrial zone, and the residential areas. The mesh was corrected, fixing the final approach geometry, and matching the real-life counterpart as much as possible. It also features a fully modeled terminal with its interior, updated apron layout and markings as of 2022, night lighting, dynamic flag animations, and FPS-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $20.06, requiring at least 163 MB of free disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BEAUTIFUL MODEL of the WORLD and AmSim have teamed up once again to build and release a rendition of Memphis International Airport (KMEM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the primary international airport serving Memphis, covering 1,600 hectares of land, sporting four runways, and averaging 4 million passengers a year as of recent.Â   Mainly a cargo airport, known as the FedEx Superhub, it processes a significant number of packages per year, featuring many nonstop destinations all across the globe, along with a network of domestic routes all over the continental United States. For 16 years (between 1993 and 2009), MEM used to be the busiest cargo airport in the World, overtaken by Hong Kong Intl. in 2010 but remained the busiest cargo airport in the country and the entire western hemisphere until 2020, when the COVID-19 eCommerce boom made it take the first place once again, although rather briefly.Â   Passenger-wise, it averages 80 flights a day, with Delta Airlines being the market share leader with 21.33% (828,000) of the total number of passengers between 2021 and 2022. American Airlines is second, with 20.36% (790,000), and Southwest is third, with 18.47% (717,000). As far as destinations are concerned, Atlanta is the busiest, with 422,000 passengers, followed by Dallas-Fort Worth and Charlotte, with 257,000 and 190,000, respectively.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with a fully modeled terminal interior, animated jetways, high-resolution custom ground textures, surrounding buildings fully modeled, parallax windows, airline codes assigned to each parking, and FSLTL compatibility.Â   Itâs available onÂ Orbx DirectÂ for roughly $22.73, requiring at least 2.53 GB of free disk space to install.

    <title>Orbx Releases Launceston Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/63c9d5f38c8a89332bff2688_launce1.jpg" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpeg" length="626040"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Launceston Airport (YMLT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the second-busiest airport in Tasmania after Hobart, with a yearly average of 1,500,000 passengers (pre-pandemic).  Qantas Group is the biggest operator in the airport, with their subsidiary (JetStar) offering up to six daily flights to and from Melbourne, two daily flights to and from Sydney, and one daily flight to Brisbane. Virgin Australia offers a similar selection with five daily flights to and from Melbourne, one to Sydney, and seasonal flights on select days to Brisbane. Airlines of Tasmania and Sharp Airlines offer a variety of short legs to nearby destinations. Its origins date back to the early 1930s, when it was established as a small grass runway for regional flights, then called The Western Junction Aerodrome. It was officially opened as a government aerodrome in 1931 when over 20,000 people watched Colonel Brinsmead - then controller of civil aviation - âcut the inaugural ribbon.â From 1932 and beyond, small aircraft would fly from Launceston to Flinders Island.  During WW2, it was used by the Royal Australian Air Force as a flight school, preparing pilots for combat. It was the only RAAF air base in Â Tasmania. Two of the hangars are still around to this day.  In the early 60s, plans for a Major redevelopment were approved, which included a runway extension, pavement strengthening, and a new terminal building. In 1982, the runway was once again extended to allow for the operation of Boeing 767s. The current privatization came in 1998, with joint ownership between the Launceston City Council and Australia Pacific Airports Corporation. The post-9/11 crisis and the rise of low-cost airlines made the airport grow in passenger traffic, reaching one million passengers for the first time in 2007.  Such exponential growth demanded another expansion, which doubled the size of the terminal and reached completion in November 2009, costing 20 million Australian dollars.  Developed by Ken Hall, an indie, who happens to be from the region and had exclusive access to the airport, taking hundreds of reference pictures to help with the accuracy and even allow for extra realism on the texturing side of things. It features a faithful recreation of the airport as it currently stands, with PBR texturing, static aircraft, detailed hangars, and terminal building. Itâs available on Orbx Direct for roughly $17.03, requiring at least 2.65 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
