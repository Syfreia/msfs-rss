    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Popular third party addon xOrganizer has officially been released for X-Plane 12 and is available now via the X-Plane.Org Store. xOrganizer is a third-party software that gives accessability and users a peace of mind when it comes to their files. While the structuring for X-Plane files can be simple, it can be challenging for new users to overcome that roadblock on their simulation journey. xOrganizer helps assist those users into structuring everything from the scenerypackages.ini file, to making sure all aircraft are up to do date. While it can keep the proper order of your scenery files, xOrganizer is also includes a scenery map, detailing where and what scenery packages you have installed and the package X-Plane is currently using. In a simple UI, it outlines plugins, aircraft, and scenery, and gives the option to the user whether or not they use the assistance of software. Customizablity is also added for the extra touch and accessablity for users. If you are interested in the full feature list, you can view it on their store page. If you interested in upgrading or purchasing this product for yourself, you can find it over at the X-Plane.Org Store. For v2 customers, check your account page and you'll see a discount code you can use at checkout.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. In a recent statement on the X-Pilot forums, IXEG developer Tom Kyler provided a brief insight into what the IXEG has been working on. In the post, Mr. Kyler alluded to the fact that his focus has been primarily on porting over the MU-2 into X-Plane 12 and that heâs closing in on the final stages of that. After the MU-2 project is completed, Mr. Kyler states that, â...the 733 will move back into rotation as the primary focus of development with the port to version 12 being the first priority.âÂ  Mr. Kyler continued to express that the IXEG 733 (in its current state), is âminimally operableâ in the updated simulator. Once the developer stabilizes the aircraft, Mr. Kyler expects they will set up a âvolunteer forumâ where people will be able to provide feedback to the developer regarding the behavior and bugs with the aircraft. Mr. Kyler also released a screenshot of the cockpit of the 733 in X-Plane 12. Concluding his statement, Mr. Kyler recommends keeping X-Plane 11 on your pc if you want to continue flying the IXEG aircraft in the interim.Â  As always, Threshold will keep you updated for any further updates from IXEG. </summary>

We will make an announcement on those things once we are about halfway through the Beta process. We know people are excited and are very appreciative of the support. Just want to make sure we can clearly see the roadmap in front of us. Our policy has been to not state firm dates until the unknowns are off the table.â â Our thanks to Nick and the team at FlightFX.

    <title>No Money Mondays: Hong Kong Kai Tak MSFS</title>
    <updated>2022-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Although it's been 24 years since the last time an airplane landed on the infamous runway 13,Kai Tak is still widely adored by flight enthusiasts all around the globe. Like the closure of Meigs Field, it marked the end of an era. Itâs impossible to talk about challenging approaches without mentioning the tricky checkerboard arrival, where a pilot had to fly low, slow, and close to apartment buildings. Pilots were also required to perform a flawless turn towards the runway, managing vertical speed and aiming for the runway threshold; simultaneously. Historically, KaiÂ Tak's runway 13 was one of the most challenging approaches in aviation history. One of the most enjoyable perks of flight simulation is the ability to bring once existing airports back virtually, providing the opportunity to experience the thrill of landing in Hong Kong as it was in the 1990s. What if I told you you could experience Kai Tak for no charge in Microsoft Flight Simulator? Scenery developer ali501 shared his rendition on flights.to so that we can all go back in time to simpler days when Avgas and Jet-A guzzling airplanes were not much of a concern. An era long left behind, now to be revived in all its glory. With a fully modeled terminal, era-accurate static vehicles, and advertisements, itâs quite a throwback. ali501's Kai Tak is the perfect blend of No Money Mondays and throwback Tuesdays! Itâs hard not to feel transported back to 1998 when you spot things like the Flight Simulator 98 advertisement or the Motorola flip phone that screams late 90s nostalgia. A trip down memory lane for older folks; and a glimpse into the past for younger people. Ready to take on the Kai Tak challenge? Download it here; at least 2.04 GB of free disk space is recommended to install the product. Installation is as simple as it could possibly be: drag the ali501-kaitak folder into your MSFS Community folder, and that's it! Stay tuned to Threshold for more freeware recommendations. â</summary>
