    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations has recently previewed the progress on their rendition of Campo dos Amarais - Prefeito Francisco Amaral State Airport (SDAM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a general aviation airport serving Campinas, the fourteenth most populous city in Brazil.  Despite not having scheduled flights throughout the year, the traffic figures sit at nearly 40 thousand passengers a year, all of that being general aviation, divided between executive jets, air taxis, and student pilots. With a total of 25 hangars and compatibility with nocturnal operations, itâs the ideal business alternative to Viracopos, the main airport in the region. Itâs operated by Rede Voa, a private Brazilian airports consortium responsible for sixteen airports scattered around the country. They won the concession to Campo dos Amarais and four airports in the SÃ£o Paulo state back in March 2017, when the previous owner, DAESP (the Airways Department of SÃ£o Paulo State), had to give up on most of their airports due to financial problems.  Developed in close contact with the operator (Rede Voa), the scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with an 85% accurate mesh, custom ground textures, custom vegetation, and more.  Thereâs no information regarding the release date or pricing, but Threshold will keep you updated! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda Design has recently released their rendition of the Cessna C337 Skymaster for X-Plane 11 and 12, part of theirÂ Dynamic Generation SeriesÂ aircraft. It is a unique light aircraft produced by Cessna Aircraft Company, known for its distinct design, featuring a twin-boom tail configuration and a rear pusher propeller, and a tractor propeller in the front. It was first introduced in 1963 and produced until 1982. The Skymaster was available in piston and turboprop versions, with the latter having a longer range and higher cruising speed. The aircraft also features retractable landing gear, making it versatile for land and water operations. It is a highly sought-after aircraft by enthusiasts and collectors, due to its design and historical significance.  Thrandaâs C337 features a fully configurable 3D instrument panel, VR compatibility, interchangeable yoke styles, over 50 instruments to choose from (movable), four panel presets (customizable), full 3D lighting, savable presets, dynamic livery editor, high-resolution PBR materials, a fully modeled Continental IO-320-F front engine, windshield ice and rain effects, and individual functional circuit breakers.Â   The fly-out menu offers a variety of features for a realistic and customizable flying experience. It includes controls for electric tug, chocks, tie-downs, covers, lights, and the option to enable or disable a Cargo Pod with realistic weight and drag characteristics. Users can also choose to start in a "cold-and-dark" state for realistic startup procedures. The menu also allows for control over landing lights, strobes, beacon, and navigation lights, as well as a detailed weight and balance manager with a visual chart and the ability to save and load configurations. Additionally, users can hide or show individual seats to create a hybrid passenger/cargo version, adjust the field of view, control audio channels in real-time, move the plane around the world with slew control, fine-tune instrument positions, swap pilot and co-pilot seats, and select different yoke styles.Â   This aircraft boasts detailed and accurate flight dynamics and weight and balance, developed with the help of multiple real-world active Stationair pilots, ensuring a proper "feel" and accurate performance during takeoff, climb, cruise, and landing. The C337 is a twin airplane where the props spin in opposite directions, canceling out torque on the airframe. In the event of a single engine failure, the flight behavior is not greatly affected as the engines are in line and do not produce a net yaw force on the plane. Additionally, tie-downs and chocks are included to keep the plane from moving in high winds. The aircraft also features DynaFeel, which simulates the strength of the control surfaces affected by oncoming air, and how much would be necessary to overcome these forces.  The aircraft features high-fidelity, multi-track sounds with smooth transitions, calculated to minimize "muddy" sounds by using the precise beat frequency for each section. It also includes atmospheric effects, allowing the user to adjust the volume of different aspects of the sound experience in real time. The sounds are divided, with different sonic characteristics for the front and back engine, and panning around the plane in exterior view yields 3D audio effects such as a "blade slapping" sound when viewed perpendicular to the prop. Far-away sounds include aerodynamic interaction effects between the front and rear propeller, and the cockpit buttons and switches each have their own unique sound. The engine also has a cool-down ticking sound based on temperature. The sounds also give clues about what's happening under the hood, and the outside wind intensity is affected by slip and AoA, making the sound louder when the surface area of the fuselage is hit by oncoming wind. Opening doors and windows also lets in outside sounds.  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $39.95, requiring at least 1.4 GB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Shadescene has recently released their rendition of Labuan Airport (WBKL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the federal territory of Labuan in Malaysia. With a yearly average of 600,000 passengers, it lies within the 20 busiest airports in the country and features in the top 10 for cargo.  The airport has a long and rich history, dating back to World War II when it was used as a military airfield by the British Royal Air Force. In the post-war period, the airport became a key hub for commercial and industrial activities, serving as a gateway to the island and the surrounding region. In the 1990s, the airport underwent modernization effort to upgrade its facilities and accommodate the growing demand for air transportation in the region. Today, Labuan Airport is considered an important regional hub, connecting passengers from various parts of Malaysia and beyond to the island of Labuan and its many attractions.  There were plans to transform Labuan into a regional hub for connecting flights within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), later postponed due to perceived unsuitability. Itâs served by AirAsia (KUL only) and Malaysia Airlines with frequent flights to Kuala Lumpur International, Kota Kinabalu, and Miri. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it currently stands, with custom terraforming, custom scenery objects, an animated radar tower, moderate terminal interior details, hand-placed taxiways and runway light system, dynamic lighting, and hand-crafted ground markings and textures. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $9.80, requiring at least 125 MB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Established developers iniBuilds have just now revealed their latest project, the famous Antonov AN-225 for Microsoft flight simulator. The Antonov An-225 Mriya was a Ukrainian six-engined super-heavy cargo aircraft, and one of the most significant cargo aircraft in the world. Developed by the Antonov Design Bureau, it was initially designed to transport the Soviet space shuttle and has since been used to transport oversized cargo, including disaster relief supplies, industrial equipment, and even military hardware. The news, which was revealed in a Livestream has shed light on the expected release date and other details about the upcoming aircraft. INI has stated that their intended release date for PC is around the 27th of February with the Xbox version coming around the same time as Sim update 12. The significance of the intended release date is to line up with the date that the real AN225 was destroyed in the ongoing war. Microsoft has also revealed that the aircraft will cost around $20 with all proceeds going toward assisting in the rebuild of the mighty AN225 in real life. It was also revealed that iniBuilds had the opportunity to meet the crew of the real AN225 in order to prepare the upcoming release and make it as realistic as possible.Â  The aircraft will feature a detailed model of both the exterior and interior along with an incredibly in-depth payload system which will allow detailed payload configurations, this will be managed through an EFB-type system. We can see from the images revealed in the live stream just how far along the project is, and how stunning it looks.Â  Threshold will endeavour to keep you updated as we learn more information!Â  â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently issued an update to their Douglas DC-6 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, including the new Working Title GNS 430, flight model and autopilot improvements, and other bug fixes.Â   The Douglas DC-6 is a piston-powered airliner and cargo aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company from 1946 to 1958, intended as a military transport near the end of WW2, but was eventually reworked to enter the commercial transport market, a task which was done rather successfully with over 700 units built. With its 2400hp radial engines, the DC-6B could fly nonstop from the eastern United States to Europe but required a fuel stop on the way back because of the winds.Â   The new update is currently available on PMDGâs Operations Center, with the marketplace edition still pending approval by Microsoft. As mentioned by Randazzo in theÂ update announcement post, many of the changes are small and focused on details, with the highlights being the implementation of the Working Title GNS 430 for the GPS and autopilot, flight model stability alterations and improvements, autopilot tuning, the increment of resolution and sharpness of some overhead panel placards, and more. The complete list follows down below: â â  The DC-6 is available on theÂ PMDG StoreÂ and the in-game Marketplace for $59.99.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. On a Twitch stream with streamer âTheFlyingFabio,â SimWorks Studios and FSReborn have announced their plans to collaborate on a Boeing 727-200 advanced for Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS). The Boeing 727 marks a large step for the two companies in MSFS, with the two previously sticking to smaller propeller aircraft, this is the first time the developers have ventured into the jet space within the simulator. The original announcement can be viewed below. SimWorks Studios have established itself as a well-trusted aircraft developer within MSFS, with the releases of their Kodiak 100, Vans RV-14, Zenith CH701 STOL, and other upcoming projects. FSReborn have also garnered a lot of respect with their Sting S4, a highly detailed propeller aircraft for MSFS.Â  Unfortunately, no further information is known, and it is unclear how detailed the aircraft will be. However, the developer did say âthe key point is to do it right.â For any further developments that arise, Threshold will make sure to keep you updated.</summary>
