    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently released their rendition of Beauvais-TillÃ© Airport (LFOB) for X-Plane 11 and 12, the tenth busiest airport in France as of 2016, with a yearly average of 4 million passengers (pre-pandemic). Itâs a popular destination for low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and WizzAir, which use it as a Parisian base.  Located only 85 km from Paris, itâs often called âParis-Beauvais Airportâ due to its proximity with the famous French city. With cheaper landing fees, less traffic and the convenience of not being in the middle of the fuss, itâs the airport of choice for many charters and LCCs. As a matter of fact, the airport has grown quite significantly after Ryanair embraced Beauvais in 1997, with the creation of a second terminal in 2010 to handle the extra traffic figures.Â   Other than WZZ and RYR with their extensive route networks to and from LFOB, the airport is also visited by Air Moldova with a single flight to Chisinau, HiSky with legs to Baia Mare and Chisinau, and EasyJet to Lisbon (flights to Milan and Nice to begin in mid-2023).Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport as it stands, with real-world airport layout, up-to-date high-definition orthoimagery, 4K photorealisitc textures, PBR textures on ground and buildings, dynamic night lighting based of real-life color tones, 3D vegetation, 3D grass, nearby houses and farms, rain and seasonal effects on ground (XP12 only), custom high-definition PBR vehicles, and fully accurate ground markings with realistic wear and tear.  Itâs available onÂ Boundless DirectÂ for roughly $17.05, requiring at least 880 MB of free disk space to install. Shout out to flightyler on Discord for the news scoop!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Xometry Design has recently updated their rendition of Eagle County Regional Airport (KEGE), adding compatibility with X-Plane 12 and extra features. EGE becomes the second busiest airport in Colorado during the ski season, because of its proximity to popular skiing resorts, and the airport offers better landing conditions overall compared to Aspen (lower minimums).  Due to its seasonality, the scheduled passenger services come and go throughout the year, but it does not let down in terms of private flights, Â featuring one of the best fixed-base private operators in the United States, the Vail Valley Jet Center, with eight heated hangars, over 30 acres of overnight storage, and planeside vehicle staging.  The new scenery update adds the aforementioned compatibility with X-Plane 12, a terminal interior, custom object rework, custom jetways, and a customized mesh with an Ortho4Xp patch, now making use of X-Plane 12âs 3D trees and bushes. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $13.57 (on sale), requiring at least 2.09 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cowan Simulation has recently released their rendition of the Bell 206B3 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a popular variant of the 206 family whose production ended in 2010 (later variants were to cease production in 2017). It is their first helicopter for MSFS, after releasing eight different models for X-Plane.  The Bell 206 had its first flight in 1962, after winning a competition held by the United States Navy to develop a Light Observation Helicopter. Their D-250 design went on to become the YHO-4, where it failed to win the contract bid, and Bell found themselves trying to market it as a civil aircraft (Model 206). The first attempt didnât work well (terrible commercial success), but an eventual redesign aiming for a sleeker and aesthetic body made it a huge success. That one was launched as the Bell 206A JetRanger.Â   The first 206B JetRanger was introduced in 1971, with the 206B-3 coming in 1977 with a modified tail rotor, and improved engine. It got popular among TV channels for traffic and news reporting, armies, police departments, and private use.Â   The add-on features 4K PBR textures, realistic start up procedure, realistic flight dynamics, custom 3D instruments, virtual reality compatible, Wwise fully dynamic sound pack, detailed night lighting, and free future updates.Â   Itâs available for purchase onÂ CowanSimâs websiteÂ for $32.99, requiring at least 2 GB of free disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently launched an update (3.00.0053) to their 737 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator, focusing on increasing the quality and performance of the product. The highlights of the update include further work on the aircraftâs stability and prevention of eventual disturbances caused by the simulatorâs exaggerated gusts, the addition of computationally derived stall angle of attack models for all wing configuration conditions on all of the three airplanes, reworked cabin collision models to allow native transition from cockpit to cabin, soundscape improvements (and expansion) in the cabin area, marked as a work in progress. The remainder of the changelog follows down below:  â Regarding the 737-900, Robert RandazzoâsÂ update announcement postÂ mentions good progress on the testing, with a few areas they intend to clean up before the release.Â   The Universal Flight Tablet is partially working but not quite ready yet due to the fact they plan to build an universal framework that allows the EFB to work across their entire aircraft lineup, including stuff that is yet to come like the 777, the 737 MAX, and the 747. Such universality takes development time, but itâs said to be coming soon.Â   The DC-6 update is waiting on an Asobo update for MSFS that has to do with the avionics, and when that is out, PMDG will be able to roll out theirs with a greater range of GPS options, improved trim and flight characteristics, and extra stability for the autopilot when tracking a course or an approach.Â   They claim to have âquite a bitâ going on behind the scenes, which will be revealed once the 737-900 and the EFB are out to the public. Â The 737 lineup is available on theÂ PMDG ShopÂ for $34.99 (737-600) and $69.99 (737-700 and 737-800, individually).Â  Images are courtesy of AllNaturalBlue.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly 2 High has recently released their rendition of Cheongju International Airport (RKTU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of Cheongwon-Ku, Daejeon, and Sejong with an yearly average of 2 million passengers. It was built as a military airbase in 1978, with the international airport plan to begin construction in 1984 and its eventual conclusion in December 1996, opening in April 1997.  Back in the 80s, Cheongju was selected as a potential construction site for Koreaâs main international airport, but Incheon ended up being the chosen one.  The airport was built to handle the current yearly traffic (2 million people) and 196 thousand airplane operations, along with a parking lot big enough for 770 cars. It also happens to house a fighter wing of the Korean Air Force, which means taking photographs of the apron, runways, and the military facilities is strictly prohibited. Itâs served by nine airlines, with a selection of domestic routes and international legs to China, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. Aero K and Asiana fly from Cheongju to Jeju, Bamboo Airways operates a seasonal leg to Quy Nhon, Jeju Air flies to Guam, Jeju, Osaka-Kansai, and Taipei-Taoyuan, Jin Air and Korean Air fly to Jeju, Sky Angkor Airlines operates a seasonal hop to Siem Reap, Tâway Air flies to Da Nang, and Yakutia Airlines operates two seasonal journeys to Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The scenery features an accurate rendition of RKTU, with custom jetways, dynamic lighting, PBR materials, animated humans, and performance friendly optimization. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $12.75, requiring at least 2 GB of free disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. SimCoders has recently released an expansion pack for the default Cirrus SR22 included in X-Plane 12, improving the flight dynamics, adding an interactive walkaround system, a mass and balance tool, a custom piston engine simulation, and more.Â   The Cirrus SR22 is a single-engine aircraft launched in 2001, manufactured in Duluth, Minnesota. Itâs an âupgradedâ SR20 with a more powerful engine, larger wings, and improved fuel capacity. Itâs one of the most successful general aviation airplanes of the past twenty years, topping the sale charts since 2003 with over 6149 units built in total (as of 2019). Itâs also the most produced GA aircraft of the 21st century.  TheÂ Reality Expansion Pack SR22Â improves the default SR22 with a substantial list of new features, including a custom flight model with realism in mind, an advanced walkaround system with the possibility to check lights, cockpit, control surfaces, engine cowls, pitot tubes, etc., a mass and balance tool with a variable center of gravity depending on the load, a complex damage system triggered by pilot actions and based on real world data, a simulation state saving so that every switch and lever stays where it was when you closed the simulator, an economy system fully compatible with FSEconomy, a custom piston engine simulation with many realistic features, a custom electrical and avionics system with realistic battery behavior, custom simulation of hypoxia with its common symptoms such as tunnel vision and hard breathing, and native VR support. The complete feature list follows down below:  â  Itâs available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $19.99.Â  Shout out to Luke on our Discord for the news scoop!
