    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  Sierrasim has recently released an updated version of their rendition of JosÃ© JoaquÃ­n de Olmedo International Airport (SEGU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Guayaquil in Ecuador with a yearly average of 3.7 million passengers.  The airport was inaugurated in October 1937 as a small airfield, initially serving as a military base.  Sixty-six years later, the airport administration made plans to build a new terminal and extend the runway, both deemed too small for the cityâs needs. At first, they had agreed to build a 28,000-square-meter terminal for international flights while using the old terminal for domestic operations. But later, they settled on a bigger terminal for both, occupying 50,000 square meters.  The current terminal can handle up to 5 million passengers a year. Once it reaches its maximum capacity, there are plans to build a new airport 20km from the city.  Itâs a hub for Avianca Ecuador and LATAM Ecuador, flying people to many destinations in Latin and North America. The visitorsâ list includes American Airlines, Copa Airlines, Iberia, JetBlue, KLM, and Spirit.  The scenery features improvements on all airport models (compared to V1), high-quality PBR textures, custom jetways, terminal interiors, new apron and airport lights, cargo terminal improvements, improved ground textures, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $18.48, requiring at least 845.02MB of free hard disk space to install. V1 owners are entitled to a free upgrade.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Henderson Executive Airport (KHND) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a public-use government airport in Henderson, Nevada, categorized as a reliever airport by the FAAâs National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems.Â   It was founded in 1967, and built on 912 acres purchased from the city of Henderson, opening three years later as Sky Harbor Airport. It was bought out by Clark County in 1996 and given its current name.  According to 2015 data, the airport had 71,323 operations, with 86% corresponding to general aviation traffic, 14% air taxi, and less than 1% military.Â   The airportâs IATA (HSH) differs from its ICAO because of Tokyo Haneda (HND), forcing it to be one of the few North American airports whose IATA doesnât correspond to the last three digits of its ICAO.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport with PBR texturing, full-detail buildings, high-resolution ground imagery, custom night lighting, high-detail airport vehicles, performance-friendly optimization, custom vegetation, and optional static aircraft.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Townsville International Airport (YBTL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Townsville in Northern Australia with a yearly average of 1 million passengers.  The airport was inaugurated in 1939, featuring two grass runways. Not long after that, it was chosen by the Department of Defence to become a military air base for World War 2. The initial plan was to house three squadrons, but they eventually settled with just one, and the base was built alongside the airport in early 1940.  After the war, commercial services flourished, with a steady increase in passenger numbers and aircraft movements as time went on, especially in the mid-60s. The 1970s saw its consolidation as a regional hub for Ansett and TAA.  A decade later, the airport benefitted from a petition started by the new owners of Ansett for international flights to begin in some regional airports, with the inaugural flight departing in April 1980 to Singapore. Later that year, they were granted 13 million dollars to build a state-of-the-art international terminal.Â   Townsville became the first regional airport in Australia to offer direct long-distance international flights. The list of direct service airlines was Qantas, Ansett, Air Niugini, Continental Micronesia, Garuda Indonesia, Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, and Japan Airlines.  The international terminal was expanded in 1987 to comport domestic traffic, followed by a huge crisis (1989-1991) that ceased most domestic operations in the country for nearly two years.  With Ansettâs liquidation in 2001, 40% of the airportâs traffic vanished into thin air, starting an era of uncertainty followed by a happy surprise: Virgin Blue (now Virgin Australia) began flying to Townsville, increasing the traffic by a respectable 25%, followed by Qantas expanding their service to make up for the gap left by Ansettâs bankruptcy.  Airnorth, Alliance Airlines, Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, QantasLink, Rex Airlines, Virgin Australia, and West Wing Aviation currently serve it.Â   The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an updated ground layout, custom ground textures, custom jetways, AI traffic compatibility, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $14.71, requiring at least 61.38 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Teikof Studio has recently released La Nubia Airport (SKMZ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Manizales in Colombia with a yearly average of 200,000 passengers.  The airport was built on a former dairy farm in 1956, whose name was also âLa Nubia.â The original runway was only 800 meters long, initially served by Aero Caldas and Aerolineas Centrales de Colombia.Â   The short runway quickly became an issue, with the expansion approval coming in 1978, lengthening the runway from 800 meters to 1,480. Construction work only started in 1982.Â   Despite the length not longer being a limitation that could prevent jetliners from operating there, thereâs a weight restriction (13,000 kg), which only makes it compatible with small regional aircraft.  The limitations go further than that: aircraft canât land on runway 28 or take off from runway ten for safety reasons (and an urban area). It also doesnât have many aids such as ILS, with most approaches being entirely visual and the weather dictating when the airport operates.Â   EasyFly serves it with flights to BogotÃ¡, Cartagena, and MedellÃ­n.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality textures and models, animated objects, custom ground markings with wear and tear, a high-fidelity terminal representation, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.08, requiring at least 393.68 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Sacramento International Airport (KSMF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, among the busiest airports in California with a yearly average of 12 million passengers.  The first purpose-built public-use airport west of the Mississippi was inaugurated as Sacramento Municipal Airport in 1967.  In 1998, a new terminal - Terminal A - was built, followed by its subsequent renaming to Sacramento International Airport. The first international flight happened in 2002 when Mexicana started a nonstop route from Guadalajara.Â   There are plans to expand the airport with more gates or a new terminal in the near future.  The current layout consists of two terminals with 32 gates in total. Air Canada, American, Delta, and United operate out of Terminal A, and Aeromexico, Alaska, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and Volaris operate out of Terminal B.  Developed by Matteo Veneziani, an independent developer, the scenery features detailed ground markings and textures, animated jetways, dynamic airport lighting, custom ground clutter, custom ground service equipment, custom taxiway signage, an animated train, basic terminal interiors, and orthoimagery of the airport area.  Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $20.06, requiring at least 2.86 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently announced the development of North Weald Airfield (EGSX) for X-Plane 11 and 12, a general aviation aerodrome in Essex, England.  The aerodrome was built during World War I by the Royal Flying Corps (which became the Royal Air Force two years later). The end of WWI saw the airport develop further with large hangars, accommodations for the pilots and personnel, and eventually becoming an important part of the British air defense during the Second World War. The control tower was built during the early Cold War modernization in 1952, currently one of the few Grade 2 listed buildings of the type in the country, and in very good condition. For the unfamiliar, a listed building is a structure of architectural or historic interest that deserves special protection. They canât be altered, demolished, or expanded without special authorization. The Officers Mess building from back then is also still around and classified as a Grade 2 listed building, along with an original hangar from 1927, dating back to the interwar development. Nowadays, itâs a general aviation airfield with over 40,000 annual movements, and it also houses the North Weald Airfield Museum with its impressive collection of vintage and veteran aircraft. Itâs home to Academy Aviation, North Weald Flight Training, and the North Weald Flying Group, offering pilot training, aircraft rental, and pleasure flights on aircraft like the Cessna 172 and the Piper PA28. Part of the field is also used to host community events, supercar driving experiences, and more. The developers have shared four preview images of the airfield on Facebook, with no information yet on features or pricing.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Shadescene has recently released their rendition of Sultan Abdul Halim Airport (WMKA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Alor Setar in Malaysia with a yearly average of 817,253 passengers.  It was established as an airfield in the early 1930s known as Lapangan Terbang Kepala Batas, becoming a military airbase soon after WW2 for the Japanese during their occupation of Malaysia.Â   The post-war period saw the ownership change to the Royal Air Force, which controlled the airfield until Malaysia gained independence in 1957.  Two years later, the airport was heavily upgraded to accommodate commercial operations, being re-inaugurated in 1965 as Alor Setar Airport. It was a domestic airport with flights to Kuala Lumpur and other major cities.  The current name was given during its redevelopment project in 2006, featuring a much larger passenger capacity, modern amenities, and more.  Itâs served by AirAsia, Batik Air Malaysia, Firefly, and Malaysia Airlines, with flights to Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru (AirAsia only).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom terraforming, custom scenery objects, a terminal interior, hand-placed taxiways, full day and night cycle, hand-crafted ground markings and textures, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $9.79, requiring at least 180.42 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MXI Design has recently released their rendition of KukÃ«s International Airport Zayed (LAKU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of KukÃ«s in Albania with a yearly average of 40,000 passengers.  The airport was built in 1929 as a domestic airfield offering an air connection to Tirana, which operated for 15 years until it was turned into a military airport.Â   Civil service was only reactivated in the late 90s, during the Kosovo War, when the United Arab Emirates organized a refugee camp in KukÃ«s, which also required an airfield for supplies. It didnât take long until they had the idea to develop a civil airport instead as a gift to the population. Two years later, an understanding was reached, and the construction work got the green light.  Construction started in 2003, reaching completion in 2005, generating more than 200 jobs, and opening more tourist opportunities for the region. On the other hand, the opening only happened very recently, in 2021, when the first-ever commercial flight took place.  The airport is served on a seasonal basis by Air Albania and Wizz Air, with five destinations in total.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, high-detailed ground textures, PBR materials, a terminal interior, 3D passengers, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.88, requiring at least 449.77 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Double T has recently released their rendition of Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (KPHF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Virginia Peninsula in the United States with a yearly average of 430,000 passengers.  The airport was built on a patch of land that belonged to Camp Patrick Henry, with commercial service starting in 1949 with Piedmont and Capital Airlines.  In 1951, a fire caused significant damage to the passenger terminal, leading to a complete rebuilding that was finished in 1955. It also included upgrading the traffic control tower and a runway extension.  In 1975, the airport was granted international status, back when it was still called Patrick Henry Airport (after the aforementioned military camp). It was served by four airlines: Allegheny, National, Piedmont, and United.  The airline deregulation of 1978 led to a massive drop in passenger numbers and airline service, with four major operators abandoning the airport one after the other.  A few years later, in 1984, they hired a new executive director to try and fix the unimpressive traffic figures. He planned to construct a business park within the airport to attract air carriers.Â   The plan was a huge success, with Newport becoming Americaâs fastest-growing airport two years in a row.  In the early 2000s, the airport was expanded to meet the demand, with new parking lots, a new passenger concourse, and, consequently, more airlines embraced Newport.  The last decade was rough with PHF, with AirTran stopping its operations after the Southwest merger and Delta suspending their service to Atlanta in 2020. Avelo brought hope in 2022, but the operations were suspended within months.  The airport is currently served by American Eagle (Charlotte) and Netjets (Birmingham, Columbus, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Raleigh-Durham, and Teterboro).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made PBR ground textures, hand-made terminals,Â cargo buildings, custom night lighting, sloped runways, custom jetways, and performance-friendly optimization.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $16.97, requiring at least 660.03 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!   â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS.  Barelli MSFS Addon has recently released their rendition of Sir Seretse Khama International Airport (FBSK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Gaborone in Botswana with a yearly average of 1.5 million passengers.  It was established in the 1950s as a small airstrip, serving as a military airfield for the British colonial administration until its independence in the mid-60s.  With the long-sought-after independence came the need for an international airport to serve the capital city. The construction started in 1980, reaching its completion and inauguration in 1984.  Itâs served by Air Botswana (Cape Town, Francistown, Harare, JohannesburgâO. R. Tambo, Kasane, Lusaka, Maun) - the local carrier -, Airlink (Johannesburg), and Ethiopian Airlines (Addis Ababa).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground markings, landside buildings, and more.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.37, requiring at least 56.07 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently uploaded a series of videos to their YouTube channel, further showcasing the upcoming F28 Professional, starting with a product overview video and four tutorials ranging from startup to landing. The Fokker F28 is a twin-engined regional jet developed in the late 1960s, first flown in 1967, and introduced two years later. Multiple variants were built, ranging from 70 seats to 89 seats in various fuselage lengths.  As of 2019, there are no current operators of the F28 around, with Fly-SAX being the last to operate it commercially. Garuda Indonesia was the largest former operator, with 62 of them. Other Major operators include the Ansett Group (13), AirQuarius Aviation (4), and Biman Bangladesh Airlines (4). The Ansett Group was also responsible for the longest nonstop F28 route in the world, between Perth and Kununurra, roughly 2300 km apart.  The first video goes through some of the main features and functionalities, variants, and their respective livery list. The subsequent videos are tutorials on operating the aircraft from cold and dark to landing. â The aircraft is set to release later today for roughly $69.99. â â â â â</summary>

    <title>Barelli MSFS Addon Releases MÃ¡laga Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2023-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Barelli MSFS Addon has recently released their rendition of MÃ¡laga Airport (LEMG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the fourth busiest airport in Spain after Madrid, Barcelona, and Palma de Mallorca, averaging 18.4 million passengers per year.  Itâs one of the oldest Spanish airports, opened in 1919, with scheduled air service starting that same year with Didier Daurat flying passengers to Barcelona, Toulouse, Alicante, Tangier, and Casablanca.  The runway had its first extension work in 1960, followed by the construction of a new passenger terminal at the very center of the site.  In 1991, a new passenger terminal (now Terminal 2) was opened, designed by Ricardo Boffil. The old terminal was transformed into a general aviation terminal four years later.  Terminal 3 was opened by King Juan Carlos in March 2010, starting operations the day after.  Only two of the three terminals are currently operating (Terminals 2 and 3). Terminal 2 is low-cost oriented, and hosts EasyJet, EasyJet Switzerland, and Ryanair, and Terminal 3 is used by the other airlines.  Being one of the busiest airports in Spain, the list of operators is substantial: itâs a focus city for EasyJet, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, and Vueling, and most European carriers regularly visit it. London Gatwick is the busiest destination, with an average of 885,608 passengers, and Barcelona is a close second with 778,527.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, landside buildings, custom ground clutter, custom night lighting, and an up-to-date ground layout.  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.23, requiring at least 261.01 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
